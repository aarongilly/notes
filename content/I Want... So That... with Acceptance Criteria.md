A concise Use Case articulation framework I saw that I liked:

| **I want** | **So that** | **Acceptance Criteria** |
| :--- | ---- | ---- |
| A dashboard of my KPIs | I can embed current status information about a goal I'm working toward into a Notion page | The creation of a dashboard that can show a chosen metric |

This is short, pithy, and contains enough for a use case *provider* to probably get across what they mean for the developer/project team to start working with.
