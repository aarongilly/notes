**Our societal system was built before technology connected us all & it will have to adapt.**

Liberalism (read: captialism and an elected governing body) is the last legitimate model now that fascism and communism have mostly died out (due to their inability to change at a rapid enough pace to keep up with technological and societal growth). But the liberal model isn't perfect and may be supplanted by something else in the future. We are transitioning between a society of small groups of humans, not much evolved beyond the monkeys we came from, into a world-wide interconnected mass of humanity. That our society has grown infinitely more complex and that understanding it to it's core is no longer possible like it was back when "community" meant "the 20 people in your tribe".
