**Relativity is all about the laws of physics being the same for all observers.**

Relativity is all about the laws of physics being the same for all observers. The speed of light is fixed for all observers and that's because the time portion of "speed" changes to make it work. Somehow that results in master and energy can be converted into one another by E=mc^2.
