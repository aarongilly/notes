**Never make piles. Things get lost & there's no end to them.**

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ Never pile things. Vertical storage is the key.

Making piles makes a space for things to get lost. More importantly, storing things on edge sets a natural limit to how much stuff you have room for. Piles can go on indefinitely.

Marie Kondo has some very Japanese thoughts about how the stuff on the bottom of the pile get a "negative energy" from having to support the stuff on top of them.
