**Clear your head of open loops & write them all down.**

One of the core components of [[GTD]]. The Mind Wipe is an exercise in which you walk through [a huge list of possible sources of tasks](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf) and identify any [[Open Loops]], writing them down. The goal is to clear the mind and truly see all the tasks, problems, unfinished plans, and undesirable conditions in front of you.
