**Christian Brose [[Christian Brose]] says that robots could be more ethical in war than people**

The argument is that self driving cars should replace regular cars not when they are perfectly safe, but when they become more safe than humans. Humans are fallible and cannot be trained to be as consistently diligent as machines. The exact same argument applies to the humans that we have fight our wars. We put them in tough situations, in harms way, give them implements of death, and then try to hold them morally accountable to make well reasoned ethical judgements. A machine ([[Killer Robots]]) can have perfect awareness of not only its environment but the entire context of the battle network. It isn't going to be overcome by fear. It could be a MORE consistent maker of the ethically correct choice. That's [[Christian Brose]]â€™s argument, at least.
