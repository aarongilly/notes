**Defining Liberalism, Socialism, and Fascism in Humanist Terms.**

## Liberalism

Values the liberties and feelings of individuals, sometimes at the expense of the masses.

## Socialism

Values the common good of the masses, sometimes at the expense of the individual.

## Fascism

Firm believers in evolutionary biology. They ascribed their values of the world to all its members. They narrowly defined what constituted "human progress" and then sought to prevent the proliferation of "bad genes". 

Literally the Nazis. This is "ends justify the means" at its worst.
