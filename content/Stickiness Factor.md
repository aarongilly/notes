**Messages that are easier to remember, by being simple, clever, or novel, are more effective at sticking with us and therefore more effective at driving action.**

They make for more effective advertising. They make for more effective education. What makes things "sticky" isn't always obvious or reproducible. Almost by a rule, humans adapt to whatever techniques are used to make messages "stick" with us and make those techniques less effective over time.
