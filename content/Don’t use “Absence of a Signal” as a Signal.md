**Don't design a system or process that uses “absence of a negative” as an assumed positive.**

I’ve seen a number of silent failures occur in my life. When designing a system or a process, don't use “If I don't hear anything I’ll assume all is well” as your approach. 

Positive confirmation of success is better than implicit assumptions of not failing.
