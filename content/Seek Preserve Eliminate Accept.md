**A series of questions to clarify direction.**

Marshall Goldsmith, CEO Coach, has a series of questions that can help a group (or individual) clarify the direction in which they need to go.

What don't we have that should we seek?

What do we have that we should preserve?

What do we have that we should eliminate?

What do we need to accept?
