**An open-source, [[Public Domain]] diagramming software.**

Draw.io is open source, available as a [[Progressive Web App]] and pretty cool. Like [[Excalidraw]], it can make graphics for free using just a browser - but DrawIO is more like Visio.

There are free integrations for DrawIO in both [[Notion]] and [[Obsidian]].

☝️ added with `Command Palette: New Diagram`, can be updated with right-click -> `edit diagram`. 

Notion actually isn't *natively* supported. Just embeds work well. When exporting as URL. Also I guess DrawIO offers a Chrome Extension for working with Notion.
