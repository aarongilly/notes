**Working at the edges of a skill to achieve greatness.**

Angela Duckworth's "*Grit"* endorses Deliberate Practice. This it has in common with (and specifically namedrops) Malcolm Gladwell, the author of *"[[Outliers]]"*, perhaps more commonly known as the "The 10,000 Hour Rule" book. It relates to Grit because deliberate practice is an act of Grit. People who are outliers are ~~almost~~ always Gritty people. Deliberate Practice is not usually pleasurable by itself, but that which yields results is inherently satisfying (see: [[Type 2 Fun]]) - so that Deliberate Practice is ultimately a worthwhile endeavor

Making Deliberate Practice into a Habit is a good way to ensure steady and long-term progress toward whatever skill you hone.
