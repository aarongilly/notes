**A simplified description of things and how they relate to one another used in software engineering and business.**

An entity relationship model ("ER Model") is a simplified description of what "entities" exist (see: [[Entity Definition]]) and how they are related to one-another ([[Entity Relationship Categories]]).  They are useful in Software & Systems Engineering, in business, and potentially useful in any other domain of study. Interestingly, there isn’t really a [[UML]] ‘Entity Relationship’ diagram - but they use [[Class Diagrams]], which are similar..

Entity relationship models name independent entities and describe how they relate to one-another via relationships, which themselves can be named, that may or may not be subject to constraints. Common relationship constraints include "cardinality" and also "role/type acceptance". 

There are a number of competing [[Entity-Relationship Modeling Standards]]. I tend to like either Crow’s Feet Notation or the even simpler yet more descriptive Min-Max pairing.
