The [[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]] offers a Venn Diagram to help clarify the boundary between SE, Systems *implementation*, and systems *management*:

Systems Engineering is like [[What is a Strategy|strategy]], you can do things without it, but those things aren't likely to result in the outcome you want. There's an observed negative correlation between what % of a budget is spent on SE and the % that budget overruns by at the completion of the project ([[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]] pg 42).

Systems Engineering has been a discipline since ~1950 when it was established within Bell Labs.
