**The two things that can lead to failure**

There are essentially two types of failures: those that come about through ignorance (where we don't know the right course of action to take), and those that come about due to ineptitude (where we know what to do, we just failed to do it). As the collective knowledge of humanity expands, the proportion of failures caused by ineptitude is quickly dwarfing failures caused by ignorance.
