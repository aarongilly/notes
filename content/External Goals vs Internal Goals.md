**Itâ€™s better to set goals that you have full control over.**

**Prefer internal goals.** They are more achievable and thereby more likely to be followed through on. They set you up for success *and* for happiness.
## External Goals
Goals dependent upon some external factor. 
### Example:
- **My goal is to win the tennis match**
	- What if the other player has a best-ever match?
- **My goal is to finish coding function X today**
	- What roadblocks might come up in coding that function

## Internal Goals
Goals wholly within your control.
### Example:
- My goal is to play my best to give me the biggest chance of winning.
- My goal is to stay focused all day on coding X
	- You can achieve this, regardless of technical roadblocks
	- [[Don't Force It]]
