**How something begins has a disproportionate effect on how it is overall.**

Begin *right*, begin *again*, or begin *together*. Utilize "temporal landmarks" to start fresh (e.g. Monday, January 1st, your birthday, Yom Kippur it doesn't matter when). 

If you start your career during a down economy, your salary is likely to still be lagging behind someone who started in a bull economy even after 20 years.
