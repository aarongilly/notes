[[Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy]] pitches a common progression through increasingly well-developed [[Enterprise Architecture]]s:

1. Business Silos
2. Standardized Technology
3. Optimized Core
4. Business Modularity
5. Dynamic Venturing *see bottom of note*

As you mature your EA, you should only take one step at a time in order to have the opportunity to learn. The juice from each step should be near fully-squeezed before you move beyond. Skipping steps is associated with worse outcomes, apparently.

In general - as you mature you can expect to see these types of improvements:

- Reduced IT Costs (to a point)
- Increased IT Responsiveness
- Enhanced Risk Management
- Increased managerial satisfaction
- Successful strategic business outcomes

### Dynamic Venturing
For whatever reason [[Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy]] decided to add a 5th stage of EA in the last 10% of the book. Dynamic venturing is about the ability to rapidly reconfigure portfolios of business. Basically, trying new ventures for business expansion by taking apart those [[Core Business Processes]] and [[Paved Roads]] that drive them and reconfiguring them in alignment with said new adventure. If your business is modular enough, if's possible. Stage 5 is about business components being [[Highly Cohesive, Loosely Coupled]].
