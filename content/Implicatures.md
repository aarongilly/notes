**Indirect ways of saying something that would otherwise be aggressive or socially unacceptable.**

Implicatures are when you say something soft that implies the meaning of something less direct. 

## Examples

- “Want to go to the movies later?” → “I have to study tonight”, it is more socially acceptable than simply saying “no”, but has the same effect.
- "It's sure hot in here" instead of "hey turn the fan on."
