**People will spend more time focusing on what's easy than what's important.**

An organization will give disproportionate time and energy talking to low-importance, but easily understood topics rather than more important, more complex issues. The example I see is a nuclear power plant designer spending time arguing about the position of the bike racks, rather than the reactor.
