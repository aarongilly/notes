> [!tldr] Starting at zero every time means you never get far from zero.

In order to grow, **you can't start from scratch every time**. Leverage your previous work. This is the essence of:

- building a pile of permanent notes
    - [[Writing is Thinking]] - an external scaffold for the mind to build on
- having [[Standard Processes]] & templates
- [[Help Future You]] - when solving new problems, keep your solution understandable and as reusable as possible for your future self
- keeping previous work accessible, discoverable, and improving on it ([[Progressive Summarization]])

If you aren't starting from scratch, but instead starting with the best assets you have ([[Intermediate Packets]]), you're minimizing work and creating progressively better projects. 

Quote from James Clear:
> How can the work you're doing today accumulate and layer on top of what you did yesterday? Find ways to compound your efforts.
