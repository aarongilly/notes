**To make principles effective, state them as verbs.**

> For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. It's not "integrity," it's "always do the right thing." It's not "innovation," it's "look at the problem from a different angle." Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea... we have a clear idea of how to act in any situation. - Simon Sinek
> 

"Simplicity" is the *value*, "Do the simplest thing" is the *principle*.
