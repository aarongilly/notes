**An under appreciated, often ignored subject**

The second-order effects of the thing you're are often more impactful than the thing itself, and not always in helpful directions. Sometimes you do something not because doing the thing is helpful, but because of its capacity for beneficial second-order effects.
### Examples
- Do a [[weekly review]]:
	- Effect: have a plan for the week
	- Second order effect: miss fewer responsibilities, Have a structure to build other systems on to
- Go lift weights
	- Effect: get a bit stronger
	- Second order effects: confidence, mood stabilization, health

## Many-to-One
A large part of the reason why second-order-effects can be impactful is because the thing you are doing has the propensity to effect MANY other things. Many opportunities for a large response to the stimulus. And all the 2nd order effects accumulate.
