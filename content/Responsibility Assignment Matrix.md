**A tool to clarify the roles & responsibilities of *agents* to aspects of an effort ([[Defining Project|projects]] or [[Defining Area|areas]])**

RASIs are a way to clarify and communicate responsibilities with regard to a thing. That thing can be a [[Defining Project|project]], [[KPIs|KPI]], [[SMART Goals|goal]], or generally maintaining an [[Defining Area|area]].

There are a variety of 'RACI'-like mappings, each with their own acronym and descriptions. What I learned originally was:

- R - Responsible - the person who ultimately owns the outcome 
	- *MUST HAVE EXACTLY ONE*
- A - Approver - approves or rejects the work at completion
- C - Consulted - a person who should be consulted, but do not actively work the task
- I - Informed - person who should be kept in the loop, but has no veto power

I've also seen, RASIC, and RASIX and tons of others. Generally it seems like they all have the above 4. Additions include:
- S - Supporter - person who provides resources to assist in the activity
