**Plant a fake number to make the real number seem better.**

Beware of **anchoring effects**, which are why you think you got a bargain if you paid too much money for an item because it was “discounted” from a ludicrously high price. Anchoring effects show up in places where they obviously shouldn't apply, such as rolling dice then guessing a percentage of teenagers who have skipped school in the past month.
