**Checking in on things once/year, but not all at once.**

The Annual Review is a great time to deep-dive on who you are, who you want to be, and how you're getting there... but there are a to of other things that need to be done ~once/year. Saving all of them for an annual review would blow up the scope of that review and turn it into a multi-day affair. 

Another practice is that of the **Distributed Annual Review**. Where you schedule once/year events into your calendar, ideally paired alongside the [[Monthly Reviews]]. This way, you aren't letting things fall off the table, but you're also not shotgunning two days in late December to do some, let's face it, not fun things.

## Distributed Annual Review Topics

- Deep dive on property management
- Deep dive on retirement
- Pull your credit reports & check those out
- Check those smoke detectors
- Taxes
- Vacation planning
- Holiday planning
- Clean out your desk & filing cabinets
- Clean out your PC
- Schedule appointments with doctor's, dentist's, and whoever else you see
