**planning is dangerous, sometimes. Doing is better.**

James Clear in his book [[Atomic Habits]] talked about the difference between “motion” and “action”. 

Motion is outlining an book.

Action is writing a draft.

Motion isn’t always bad, you should usually have some idea of your plan, but rethinking something before turning your previous plan into *action* is when you’re spinning your wheels.

[[Learn by Doing]]. Run [[[Low-Cost Trials]] and see how it goes.

> [!tldr] 🚫 Planning fools you into **thinking** you’re making progress, when really you’re just avoiding failure (and by doing so, failing to achieve anything real).

The correct approach is a balanced one. Trust your [[Periodic Reviews]] and dedicated project planning sessions. Now: do more. Think less.
