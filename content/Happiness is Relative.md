**Happiness is a state relative to the individual.**

Human capabilities, technology, and abundance of resources have not necessarily made humans happier. A mud hut built by a caveman would make him basically exactly as happy as a mansion bought by a wealthy person today. The comparative reality of the two things physically achieved make no difference in the levels of happiness of the two individuals for their achievements.
