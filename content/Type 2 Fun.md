**Suffering now; fun after the fact, in retrospect**

Not everything that you *should want* to do is "fun" in the classical sense of the word. Some things are, but some things only become fun after the fact. Fun, here, meaning basically "feels good". 

You should try to remember when doing Type 2 activities, that they are, indeed, "fun".

James Stuber categorizes "fun" into two buckets:

## Type 1 Fun
Stuff that's fun **right now**. Eating ice cream. Sliding down a hill on a sled. Playing with a puppy.

## Type 2 Fun
Stuff that's *not fun* right now, but **becomes fun upon reflection**. These would be like a Tough Mudder. Exercise. Group study.

You could almost marry these up to [[Systems 1 & 2]]. Type 1 fun goes with [[System 1]]. Type 2 fun is slower, like [[System 2]]. You could also say that Type 2 fun is the *opposite* of [[Anticipatory Anxiety]] - it's pain now suffered in anticipation of a good thing later.

If you waste your entire day having [[Effortless vs Effortful Fun|Low-Effort Fun]], you may wind up **not** being able to enjoy yourself at *all*. Like all things, the key is [[Balance]].
