**Habits are the compounding interest of self-improvement**

### Source

**Habits are the compounding interest of self improvement.** Each little thing itself doesn't have much effect, but the cumulative effects are significant. A 1% bump each day for a year results in a year-over-year performance increase of 37x.

This goes in both directions. Good habits accumulate to great results, bad habits accumulate to catastrophe.
