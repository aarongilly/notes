**Habits are the compounding interest of self-improvement**

Each little thing itself doesn't have much effect, but the cumulative effects are significant. A 1% bump each day for a year results in a year-over-year performance increase of 37x. [[Prefer a Long-Term Philosophy]]. 

This goes in both directions. Good habits accumulate to great results, bad habits accumulate to catastrophe.

Due to the [[Habitâ†”Identity Feedback Loop]], **you are what you do repeatedly**.
