This word keeps coming up, and its definition doesn't really explain how it was used. This one does, though, per MDN Web-docs:

> Software specification often contain information marked as **non-normative** or _informative_, which is provided to help readers understand the specification better, or to show an example or best practice. **Non-normative parts of the specification are provided as guidelines, and are not considered part of the formal specification.** Sections that contain the official part of the specification are often marked as normative.
