**Making "breaking the routine" part of the routine.**

"Routinized Variety' is a good term used by Christine Carter in "[[The Sweet Spot]] " to describe building "do something new" into your routine. This enable you to stick with a routine that allows you to consistently build yourself toward the person you want to be, while at the same time ensuring that you don't get sick of that person, or wake up one day and realize you've done nothing new in the past X years. 

## Examples

- Periodic date nights where you cannot go someplace you've been before.
- An annual vacation to someplace new
- The concept of the [[30 Day Challenge]]
- Saying "Yes" more
