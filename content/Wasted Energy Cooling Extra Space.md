**A collection of sources of waste.**

Much like how a car is inherently inefficient due to itâ€™s own weight ([[Car Inefficiency from Weight]]) - you heat and cool your **entire house** so that **you** are a good temperature. You could wear more clothes (or fewer) and use less energy. OR you could just not have a ton of extra space in your house. Vaulted ceilings are nice, but hold a lot of air that needs conditioned.

This is one of the benefits of [[Tiny House]]s.
