**Depending on task, either depth or breadth may be more important.**

In his book "*Range*", David Epstein starts with a comparison of two well-known athletes: Tiger Woods, and Roger Federer. Tiger was very much a specialist from early age. He lived and breathed golf and was training from before he could even walk. He became the top of this field. Roger Federer was another athlete at the top of his field, and his upbringing was very different. He tried out all sorts of sports. Developing talents and acumen in each one before specializing in tennis at a fairly late age. The point is that you donâ€™t have to solely dedicate yourself to one thing your whole life to become great at it.

Chess players have focused heavily on being great at chess, but are nowhere near as good as modern machines. Meanwhile more dynamic tasks are still beat performed by humans, who are adaptive to problems, employing knowledge gained from every aspect of life.
