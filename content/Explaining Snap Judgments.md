**People's gut will make up its mind, then their head will justify the gut decision for reasons that aren't true.**

When people are put into situations where they have to make [[Snap Judgments]], they will often make up rational, plausible-sounding explanations for why they "reasoned out" the conclusion they jumped to - when in reality the intellectual reasons probably had nothing to do with those conclusions at all. They were [[Emotional Decisions]]. People don't realize they are making up reasons. We all fool ourselves into thinking we know why we decided what we did, when the real reason is locked behind the door of the unconscious.
