**Boundaries are freeing, not restricting.**

Boundaries are freeing, not restricting. **Set your own boundaries, or other people will build them around you according to their needs**. Boundaries, ironically, are not limited to bounding your time - bound the problems you're willing to bring on to those that are worth your time. Don't feed a village of hungry people by giving them fish. Look for requests where people ask you to do something, and you feel resentful about it. Set boundaries there. 

Don't work late. The people you love shouldn't be getting whatever time you have left over.
