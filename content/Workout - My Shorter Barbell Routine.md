**A shorter version of my Half-Random Routine, that removes the randomness factor.**

Same as the [[Workout - Half-Random Routine]], but with a single non-compound move afterwards. Done every-other-day, ideally.

1. Bench 5x5 → Squat 3x8 → Pull-ups (assisted) 2x15
    1. Triceps Extensions 2xAMRAP
2. Deadlift 5x5 → Rows 3x8 → Press 2x15
    1. Ab Wheel 2xAMRAP 
3. Squat 5x5 → Pull-ups 3x8 → Bench 2x15
    1. Arnold Press 2xAMRAP 
4. Rows 5x5 → Presses 3x8 → Deadlift 2x15
    1. Concentration Curl 2xAMRAP 
5. Pull-ups 5x5 → Bench 3x8 → Squat 2x15
    1. Skullcrushers 2xAMRAP 
6. Press 5x5 → Deadlift 3x8 → Rows 2x15
    1. Incline curl 2xAMRAP

I've played around with variations on this. Seems like a lot of room to wiggle.
- Swap out exercises for similar ones
- Play with set and rep ranges some
	- 4x4, 3x5, 2x15 
	- 5x5, 3x8, 2x12
- Change around the final move
