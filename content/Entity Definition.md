**"A thing capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified"**

An "Entity" is a thing that is capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified. Per Wikipedia.

Entities can relate to one another via any number of relationships, which themselves could be entities. An entity fulfills a *role* within the relationship. There may be constraints on the cardinality of the relationship between two entities. Commonly: mix-max.
