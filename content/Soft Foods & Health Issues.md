**Soft foods have given us bad teeth, sinus issues, and breathing problems.**

We have processed all the nutrients out of our foods AND made them all soft. The softness of our foods leads our mouths to become underdeveloped, bad teeth, and sinus obstruction and breathing maladies. Native Americans (and other such cultures) all had broad jaws, larger nasal cavities, and brilliant dental health - despite lack of access to dentistry. It wasn't needed. Their facial structure reacted to their need to chew & process hard, chewy foods for their daily sustenance.
