**You are not important, and that’s okay.**

Recognize that you are not God. It doesn’t need to be any particular God. It doesn’t need to be anything beyond “nature” or “the universe”. Recognize that you are not all there is. You are actually a very tiny, insignificant part of all there is.

That’s okay.

When your problems get overwhelming, remember how little they matter in the grand scheme of things. When you’re reaching the end of your life, recognize that the world will go on - and the best thing you can do is try to make it better for those who’s time hasn’t yet come.
