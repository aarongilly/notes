**Most common plights have obvious, albeit unsexy solutions.**

Most common plights have obvious, albeit unsexy solutions. People don't want to hear the fix to their biggest problem is actually incredibly simple... but genuinely most of the chronic problems people deal with have a "one simple trick" that they aren't doing, because it's too simple and not interesting.

## Examples

"I wish I was skinnier" → eat fewer calories

"I wish I were stronger" → lift heavy weights more often

"I'm broke" → use a budget

"I wish I had more time" → stop wasting the time you do have

"I'm bored" → read a book

"I wish I could stop smoking" → stop buying cigarettes
