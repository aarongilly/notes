**`= this.summary`**

The 3-3-3 Method is developed by the dude who wrote [[4000 Weeks]], Oliver Burkeman. It suggests that you use each day to try to achieve 3 sets of 3 things:
1. 3 hours of [[Deep Work]] on a passion project.
2. 3 urgent, but less time-consuming tasks
3. 3 maintenance activities
