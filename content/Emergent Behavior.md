A great evocative example of emergence:

Emergence is a **macro-level** property of systems, in particular [[System Complexity|complex systems]].

Emergence is ultimately what we're going for when we create systems. The types of emergence we "expect" and design the system to accomplish are called *simple emergence*. There are, however, often (or always) *unexpected* emergences, called **strong emergence**. These can be difficult-to-impossible to predict and can be catastrophic. [[Iteration is the Only Effective Method of Controlling Emergence]].
