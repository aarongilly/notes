**Pleasure is not enjoyment. They are related, but not synonymous. Both are possible without the other.**

There's a difference between "pleasure" and "enjoyment". We typically enjoy pleasure, but **not everything we enjoy is pleasurable - nor is every pleasure enjoyed**. A hard nights work producing a new piece of art may not be very pleasure-filled, but it could be quite enjoyable. Meanwhile a beer, drunken hastily while we focus on problems at work, or the bad call a ref just made - although pleasurable, may not be enjoyed at all. **We are predisposed to seeking pleasure, even when it doesn't bring about enjoyment.** 

> [!tldr] ⚠️ Enjoyment is cultivated. It's more difficult, but infinitely more worth your while.
