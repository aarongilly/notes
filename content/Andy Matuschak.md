summary: A dude who takes public notes and is highly influential on Obsidian

**`= this.summary`**

Andy Matuschak seems like a dude who's found a way to make his job into doing what I'm doing right now. There's more to it, surely, but I've come to sense his presence through his influence on [[Obsidian]] and his meditations on the utility of tools, notes, and knowledge work. 

He seems to really be into the idea of [[Spaced Repetition]].
