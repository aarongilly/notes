Exerting control is rewarding. Simply deciding on something, no matter how trivial, can activate the reward pathways in the brain. This is what we're exploiting with the [[2 Minute Rule of Habits]]. You may not be fully getting a workout, but you're *making the choice* to get started. You are still casting that vote. You're still **acting**. This keeps you firmly in the realm of those who *do*, not those who are stagnant.

Personal growth almost requires the conscious *choice* to do the hard things. [[Toughness Training Requires Autonomy]]. You can't force someone to work hard at gunpoint then expect them to become better workers. They have to make the choice, using an internal [[Locus of Control]]. 

Having things simply "happen to you" is less satisfying than it is to decide you want them to happen, then act, then receive them.
