**[[Focus]] by Training Yourself to Crave Less [[Dopamine]]**

The dude who made the Marble Machine X slowly weaned himself off sources of dopamine. He was good to [[Embrace Boredom]]. He turned off audio input. He turned off his phone. He called it a **Dopamine Detox** and credits it with a 10x increase in productivity. 

## To increase focus:
Do these things.
- Stop listening to podcasts
- Close out of Skype
- Close out of Outlook (with alarms set for meetings elsewhere)
- Close all browsers
- Close all applications other than what youâ€™re doing
