**A The Prisoner's Dilemma [[The Prisoner's Dilemma]] **

Robots already have everything they need to kill. Your Tesla could get turned into a civilian ramming machine via a software update. Drones are capable of autonomous reconnaissance. Arming them would be essentially trivially easy. The technology is not what's stopping us. Whats stopping us is the ethics. But if the “other guys” have the technology, but can't be trusted to share your values AND if NOT having them represents a significant disadvantage in a potential conflict, then is it really the “right” thing to do to stick by your values and keep the human making the decision on pulling the trigger.
