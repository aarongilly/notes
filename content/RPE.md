**Rate of Perceived Exertion - an exercise-effort measurement method**

RPE, or “Rate of Perceived Exertion” is a subjective measure of how hard you're pushing in a weightlifting set. It's measured from 1 to 10, and can also be thought of as an inverse measure of “number of reps left in the tank” (where an RPE of 10 means 0 possible additional reps, RPE of 9 means you could probably have done 1 more).

Objective [[Proxy Measures]]:
- timing the concentric part of the rep
