**Microsoft’s trademark for context-aware suggestions while writing code. It’s great.**

Intellisense is great. I don’t have a ton to say about it, but might find tricks and tips later, hypothetically. This place would be a good spot for them. 

Use [[JSDoc]] and/or [[TypeScript]] to super-power your intellisense. 

Intellisense is part of what makes [[Interface Object-Oriented Definition]] usage so handy.
