**Daily reviews are a common, good, and easy habit. **

> Plan weekly, review daily. - Andrey Sergeyev
> 

The concept of a daily review is not new. They've been used by famous thinkers and politicians and writers throughouts time. 

To help build the habit - utilize the [[2 Minute Rule of Habits]]. Make the scope of the review incredibly narrow. Write one sentence about the day. Or use automation to generate a dashboard of your items to review. There are a bunch of apps and services you could use to help wrangle your data... or you could build one from scratch. A Google Form is a great and easy starting point.

## Good Items for Daily Reviews

- Write a journal entry recapping the day
- Write the biggest accomplishment
- Write down your biggest stressors
- Write one gratitude
- Review quantified self metrics
- Look at your calendar or task list for today and tomorrow
- Look at your GTD Inbox
