**It hurts about the same to lose “x” than it does to not gain “2x”.**

The experience of losing $10 is more painful than the joy of finding $10. This is called **loss aversion** and is human nature. The ratio is different from person to person but the **curve of indifference** is weighted about 2 to 1 for foregone gains against realized losses.

> [!tldr] ➡️ **Curve of Indifference**: losing $10 you already have hurts about the same as a missed opportunity for a free $20.
