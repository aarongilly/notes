Rules of thumb are how the ancient Greeks built cathedrals that still stand today. They were developed not through theory, but instead through passing down the techniques used that [[Empirical]] observations proved to work. They tried things. The things that worked, they kept on using. 

**Rules of Thumb are what gets used when the situation is not fully understood.** 

They may not be perfect (in fact, they almost certainly aren't), but they are "good enough" for [[Satisficing]] the situation. If they stop working, they stop being passed down and used. [[The Things We Make]] includes rules of thumb in its definition of "[[The Engineering Method]]".
