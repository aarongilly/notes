**Use standard processes, find improvements, update the standards**

Utilize repeatable, standard methods to perform all regular actions. Allow for individuals to find enough freedom within these tasks to make improvements, and when those improvements are found, quickly build them into the standard. This way the best way becomes the standard way.

## Includes

- Written [[Standard Processes]]
- [[Checklists]]
- [[Other Forms of Checklist]]
- Template forms or folders - [[Intermediate Packets]]
- Standard modules (e.g. these notes)
