**A Danish concept relating to happiness.**

"Hygge" is a Danish word. It's a concept they have in Denmark that relates to happiness, although that's not its direct translation. Hygge is a noun, adjective, and verb. It's uniquely Danish and 30% of Danes say it can't even be translated into other languages. It's talked about in Denmark a lot, according to [The Little Book of [[The Little Book of Hygge]]

Hygge has to do with having and enjoying a great atmosphere, perhaps with a few good friends, perhaps while sharing in a treat. It's about feeling cozy and safe and in the exact moment you're living. Enjoying life now.
