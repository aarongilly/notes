**Trying to will into existence the thing you're afraid of happening as a means of seeing it isn't worth fearing**

One way to break free of [[Anticipatory Anxiety]] is to attempt to for e the negative outcome to happen. 

A man who had chronic perspiration was told to try to perspire as much as he possibly could. He wound up sweating *less* because he fear of sweating too much was abated. 

This too is why you cannot expect good results when you try to "force" certain things. If you FORCE trying to relax, it's impossible. You cannot will yourself to sleep. You're actually more likely to fall asleep faster if you lie there trying to stay awake (minus your phone).
