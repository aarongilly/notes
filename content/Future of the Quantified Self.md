**With more data and artificial intelligence, it will soon be stupid NOT to listen to your FitBit.**

The quantified self movement states that measuring your self allows access to *you* by algorithmic analysis. Algorithms may know you better than you know yourself. They may make better decisions for your overall health and happiness than you do. 

It might make more sense to trust whatever replaces [Cupid.com](http://cupid.com) says about who you'd love, because it's reading your biometric responses to dating prospects... and reading the state of the body and the brain of both you and the person you're dating before, during, and after the dates themselves. 

Anyone who goes against the algorithm will be taking a risk that they know themselves and the world better than this all-knowing computer. They will, on the whole, be less successful than those who trust in the best guesses of the best guessers - the computers.
