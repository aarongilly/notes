**If you don't want to do it at all, commit for just a couple minutes.**

A recurring theme that comes up is the notion of the tiny commitment that's easily upheld that gets the ball rolling. Master the management of applying yourself for the smallest amount of time, energy, and [[focus]]. 

This technique only works if you trust yourself that you *can* stop in 2 minutes, but also *allow yourself to keep going* if you want to.

This phrase could also be used to describe pilot programs and exploratory projects. You need to star at down a path to evaluate it, because [[Low-Cost Trials|optionality]] is good.
