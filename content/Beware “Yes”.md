**When negotiating, it's good to let your opponent say "no" for a while**

Often times it is better to get someone whom you're trying to influence to say “no” many times before you get to where they might say yes. This puts them into the mind frame of feeling control of the situation. They get to feel the feeling of assert their position by saying “no”. If you ask people to say “yes” too early, it puts people's guard up.
