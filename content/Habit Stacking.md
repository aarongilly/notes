**Use something you're already doing as a cue to do something you're trying to start doing.**

Habit Stacking is using a current behavior as a cue for the habit you want. This is a clear and easy example of [[Implementation Intentions]].  

Utilize things you already do every day as triggers for things you want to do every day. This doesn't have to be only for daily habits.

You can chain habits via recursive stacking. Use one habit as a cue for another, then that as a cue for a third.

## Examples

- Wash your car after paying your monthly mortgage.
- Wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.
- Fill your water bottle every time you go pee.
- Do 3 pushups every time you fill your water bottle.
