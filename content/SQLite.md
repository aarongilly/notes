**A single-file, lightweight [[SQL]] database platform**

SQLite is data and the database software all wrapped into one file. 

SQLite is [[Public Domain]], but the code is marked as "Open-Source, not Open-Contribution". Basically they don't accept patches or updates from people unless those people sign affidavits saying they dedicate their contribution to the public domain.

SQLite is used *everywhere*, according to Simon Willison, the guy behind Datasette.
