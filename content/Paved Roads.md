"Paved Roads" is a term I saw somewhere to describe those processes that a system is designed to primarily support. While your software/business/process might have *extension points* or ancillary capabilities, it should also have *paved roads* that indicate to a user "this is the way we expect you to go". Those things that its designed around and expects people to use. This is the beginning of the [[Pit of Success]]. Paved Roads provide **clarity**. They say "go here". 

They are ineffective when they don't go where users actually want to go. You need to know your system's purpose.
### Signs of a paved road:

- Prominent & consistent entry points *(e.g. Windows "Start" menu)*
- [[Affordances]]
- Clear signs of consideration & optimization
- easy buttons, templates, and [[Other Forms of Checklist]]
- Documentation & training made available
