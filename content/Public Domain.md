**Stuff that nobody has copyright on that you can do anything with**

Public Domain stuff is cool. 

By law, most things go into the public domain after a long enough time period has elapsed, but also it's possible for things to be put into the open domain as they are created (see: [[SQLite]], most other Open-Source software)

> In most countries the [term of protection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths "List of countries' copyright lengths") of copyright expires on the first day of January, 70 years after the death of the latest living author.
