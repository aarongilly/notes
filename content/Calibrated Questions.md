**Open-ended questions with no wrong or right answer.**

A negotiation technique, **calibrated questions** are questions like “how am I supposed to do that?” - the type of open-ended question that has no right or wrong answer, but instead is designed to keep the conversation going. Giving the other person in a negotiation the chance to rethink what they’re asking for and giving them a feeling of control.
