The biggest challenge to the man who can have anything is knowing what he wants. Being overloaded with information leads to [[Decision Fatigue]]. The vital few are overwhelmed by the trivial many. 

If you have bings and beeps and buzzes going off around you constantly, youâ€™ll never have space to think.
