**People give loans when the future is bright & the future is bright when people get loans.**

People only continue to act in good faith (making and repaying loans, making purchases beyond whatâ€™s absolutely physically required) when they feel that their future is bright. If the pie is not growing, suddenly the world becomes a zero sum game, and your gain is my loss. The growth we are enjoying is somewhat self-sustaining. However, It is also true that stagnation begets stagnation.
