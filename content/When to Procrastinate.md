**Sometimes procrastination is a good thing.**

Because your [[First Idea ≠ Best Idea]], sometimes it's useful to procrastinate. Procrastination allows for more time committed to divergent thinking. Rather than picking the first promising track and committing to it, you have an opportunity to let the idea play around in your conscious and unconscious mind. In a group, sometimes it’s not good to jump to solutions right away - [[Group Ideation Timing]].

You definitely want to leave enough time to complete the work and edit it... but don't commit to a direction too early.
