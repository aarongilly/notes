**Time Blocking is only successful if you’re present in your block.**

Controlling where your mind is during a time block is every bit as, of not more, important than working the task at hand. It is, unfortunately, easier said than done. [[Meditation]] practice can help you with this. So, too, can eliminating distractions from the environment.

When entering and exiting a time block, pause and refresh the mind. Take a break and clear your head. Don’t linger over what you have just done. Don’t think about anything other than [[What's Important Now]]. 

### Ad Hoc Techniques
- [[Treat Work Sessions like the Cinema]] - make sure you have what you need and don't have what you don't
- Write down or say out loud what you're about to [[Focus]] on, and how you'll know when it's time to stop.
- Do a [[Head Clearing Exercise]]
