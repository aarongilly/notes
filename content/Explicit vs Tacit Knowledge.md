**Explicit - having recipe to read. Tacit - knowing how to make it**

There are two categories of knowledge: Explicit and Tacit. Explicit Knowledge is expressed in words and numbers, easily stored and transferred. Explicit Knowledge is what’s baked into Standard Operation Procedures. Tacit Knowledge is your ********know how********. It’s personal, hard to share.

Put differently: Explicit Knowledge = knowing *what* to do. Tacit knowledge = knowing *how* to do it.
