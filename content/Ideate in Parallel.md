**It's better to generate 10 ideas at once, then pick the best rather than generate one idea and iterate 10 times.**

If you sit down to come up with a solution to a problem, it is better to come up with *many* ideas all at once, rather than come up with *one* idea, then iterate on it overt and over. 5 simultaneous ideas often produce a better result than 1 idea iterated on 5 times. It's also better to focus on quantity, not quality. Variety and quantity will yield more opportunities for derivation, combination, and new solutions to problems.
