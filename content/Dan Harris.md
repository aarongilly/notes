**Reporter, Meditation advocate, author of "[[10 Percent Happier|10% Happier]]".**

Dan Harris was a young successful reporter and news anchor for ABC News. He was shot at during his reporting in the middle of literal war zones. Once he was no longer reporting from active war zones, he started up doing hard drugs. He famously had a panic attack on live TV. He found a book that partially resonated with him. An Eckhart Tolle book about the little voice in your head throughout the day intrigued Harris. He met with Deepak Chopra to try to figure out how to silence the voice in his head. It didn't work. Eventually he discovered Buddhism through Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist, who had a much more practical approach, and much less grandiose claims. Mark suggested Dan go on a 10 Day Buddhist meditation retreat, which altered the trajectory of Dan's life. Dan now meditates 30 minutes each day.
