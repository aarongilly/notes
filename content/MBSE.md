**Model-Based Systems Engineering**

Model Based Systems Engineering is the practice of performing and delivering common system engineering functions through the use of well-formed, well-organized models. Model Based Systems Engineering is perhaps best defined by what it’s *not*, which is document-centric systems engineering (aka traditional systems engineering). Document-based approaches containerize information into text document artifacts, which must be read and comprehended through great effort before a total system view can come into focus. Model-based approaches don’t force information into document-form, and thus can more closely resemble the systems they document. They allow for minimum repetitions ([[DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)]]) and much greater agility. System models may also be consumable by machines, which then offers modelers great tooling utilities. Systems can be simulated. Models can be validated. Models can be queried in ways that documents never could. MBSE enables things like running a query for everything in a system which satisfies a given requirement, or depends on a given system element, or utilizes a particular interface.

There are many competing methods for accomplishing MBSE, 3 which I have focused on in some length are [[SysML]], [[OPM]], and the [[IDEF]] family of methods.
