**Think about the process, not the result.**

Thinking about the technical aspects of shooting an arrow is a sure way to miss a target. Forcing a free throw to go in is the best way to brick the shot. Trying to hit a golf ball hard is a recipe for failure. 

Following the process, without regard for the result, will inevitably, almost paradoxically produce a better result. The closer you get to mastery, the less you care about specific results.
