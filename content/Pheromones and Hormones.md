summary: Chemical messages sent between individuals or between distinct parts of the body, respectively.
---
Both pheromones and hormones are forms chemical messages generated in one location to illicit a response in another location. The difference between pheromones and hormones is that pheromones are meant to send messages between distinct individuals, whereas hormones are meant to send messages between distinct parts of the body within a single individual.

So: 
**Pheromones = between individuals
Hormones = within an individual**
