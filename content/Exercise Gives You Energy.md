> [!success] You don't exercise because you *have* energy, you exercise because ***it gives you energy***

This is a conclusion you've come to [[Empirical]]ly. It's in the literature, but it's in real life, too.

Exercise takes energy to do, but **it returns a higher baseline of energy**. You may end a workout tired, but mentally you're more alert. You bring on endorphins that last with you for hours. Your minute-to-minute energy levels are improved when your day-to-day routine includes some level of intentional physical exertions. 

Exercise also helps regulate your mental and emotional well-being as well. You can complete the [[Stress Response Cycle]]. You can feel secure in knowing you're doing what you can to increase your [[Healthspan vs Lifespan|healthspan]].
