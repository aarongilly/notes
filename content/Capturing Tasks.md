**The GTD portion of ongoing capture.**

This is the [[GTD]] category of ongoing capture. As the need for new tasks come up, use the [[2 Minute Rule of GTD]] on short ones, use your [[Inbox]] to capture things quickly, or if you have more time, add the task directly to an associated project ([[Defining  Project ]]) in your [[Project Lists]] and create any helpful [[Contextual Reminders]] to help you address the task when necessary.  

Where possible, [[Help Future You]] by pre-loading the reminders with necessary metadata, links, references, or by accomplishing some of the work in advance.
