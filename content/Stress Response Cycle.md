summary: Strategies for getting your body through stress, and dealing with it.
---
Stress is an adaptive trait. We evolved to be stressed to be able to deal with threats. Our body expects to see the lion, then run like hell. 

> [!tip ] Lingering Stress
> If you see the lion and it dies of a heart attack, and you **don't** have to run, you will carry some part of that stress with you. 

Your body doesn't recognize the signal. **It cares about the stress, not the stressors**. 

Here are some means to de-stress:
1. **Exercise** - physical movement that elevates the heart rate
2. **Breathe slowly** - especially on the exhale
3. Talk to someone, anyone, have a pleasant interaction 
4. **Laughing** - good hard laughs
5. **Connect** with , especially those we love 
6. ....and others. There's a bunch.
