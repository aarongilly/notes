**A wiki with structured entries and meaningful links between them.**

A semantic wiki is a wiki in which both the entries and the relationships between them can be “typed” with names and associated metadata. A semantic wiki differs from a regular wiki because it allows for implicit  knowledge inference and for robust queries using languages like you'd find in a [[Graph Database]]. Semantic wikis can be considered a form of [[Ontology]] software.
