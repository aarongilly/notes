**A localized region of the brain allows you to switch [[focus]], at a cost of some energy.**

The Attentional Switch is part of the [[Human Attentional System]], which allows the Central Executive function to [[focus]] on one thing wholly, then bridge over to a new thing.

Operating the switch (changing your focus) takes literal cellular energy. This is related to [[Context Loading]] and is part of the reasons behind [[Decision Fatigue]]. 

The switch apparently is localized to a certain spot within the brain.
