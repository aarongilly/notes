**Diversity & creativity are spurred by not-too-big, not-too-small disturbances in the natural order of things.**

If you want a diversity of species in an area, you're best likely to find that in areas where disturbances happen *some*. Not too much because nothing can survive but the heartiest species. If nothing happens, then nothing changes. You need *just enough*. 

This same concept can be applied to creativity. You need *some* mixups to break up your train of thought and open up the solution space to more ideas, but not so many that you never gain [[Traction]] on any one solution.
