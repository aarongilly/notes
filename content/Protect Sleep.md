**Sleep enables everything else. Don't make a trade-off against it.**

Sleep is essential. Do one less thing tonight to do much more tomorrow. Sacrificing sleep forces sacrifices everywhere else. Consistently sleeping enough, at consistent times, has been widely correlated with all sorts of positive physical health, mental health, happiness, and productivity benefits.

**You must prioritize sleep**. Sleep deprivation inhibits your ability to prioritize everything else. This is the [[P-PC Balance]] balance all over again.
