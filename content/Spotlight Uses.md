## Spotlight > Shortcuts
Spotlight's biggest superpower is the ability to call up [[Shortcuts App]] shortcuts to do whatever you can think of. Here's a incomplete list of those I built/use frequently.

### New Task
Receives text. Attempts to parse a date. Pushes the text (& optionally, date) to my Notion "Tasks" database [[Task Manager]] using a Google Apps Script Web App as an intermediary. 

### Track PDW Thing
Shoots out to a boatload of shortcuts that ultimately write to the [[PDW]].
