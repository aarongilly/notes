**Potentially a huge part of what makes up each of us.**

According to Nicole LePera, author of “[[How To Do the Work]]”, a huge part of our enduring personalities for our entires lives is the traumatic experiences we experienced in childhood - even if we can’t really remember what they were. She argues that our brains forms, our sense of self forms, our senses of how the world works and how people work and everything are formed during our childhoods. When we experience anything that leapfrogs over our abilities to deal with them as children, we will internalize whatever the ramifications of that event are. It may manifest in our relationship with our spouse later on, or out relationship with our friends or family. It could manifest in the words we call ourselves and the stories our [[Internal Narrator]] says.
