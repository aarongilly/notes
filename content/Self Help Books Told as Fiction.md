I can't stand books that are told through a fictional lens, where the **point** of the book is not that fiction. So-called "Self Help" books, where the "self help" lessons are 100% the focus of the book **should not be crammed into a fiction**. There have only been three books that have tried this technique, and every single one of them I found so grating I couldn't finish.

1. The 5 A.M. Club
2. Leadership and Self-Deception

These don’t read as interesting diction. They don’t read as good discussion of philosophy. They suck. 

Also: while it doesn't perfectly fit the description - a *negative* shout-out to **Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**, which is basically a philosophy book told through a bad fiction lens.
