**How much money you’re actually spending each month on average.**

Your ‘Burn Rate’ is the amount of money you’re spending each month, on average. It’s variable, obviously, and is probably a good candidate for calculation using a rolling average. I like to use at least ~6 months for the rolling average. 

Your [[Budget]] should be set after closely analyzing your burn rate.
