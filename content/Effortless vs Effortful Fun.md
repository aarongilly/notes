summary: One you'll never regret, the other you'll never remember.

**`= this.summary`**

Effortless fun (scrolling through social media, watching dumb videos) doesn’t make memories. Effortful fun, despite being more work, are what leads to a fulfilling and memorable life. You’ll never regret having effortful fun, you’ll never remember having effortless fun. 

Effortless fun can actually be numbing ([[Numbing vs Pleasure]])

We may call it fun, but we may not really enjoy it. [[Pleasure vs Enjoyment]]
