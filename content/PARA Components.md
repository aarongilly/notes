**Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive**

1. Projects - [[Defining  Project ]] 
2. Areas - [[Defining Area ]] 
3. Resources - a topic or theme of ongoing interest, in my case it's this second brain (and per project notes stored with the Projects themselves)
4. Archive - non-current activities and information from any of the 3 previous areas
