**Learning how to best learn a thing**

Metalearning is learning about how to learn a particular topic. This is pure research. This is a higher level of abstraction. You learn about the structure of the information that you will be learning about, and how you could take it apart. Learn about the resources available to you to use for learning, and how those things might map to the [[Concepts, Facts, and Procedures]] involved.
