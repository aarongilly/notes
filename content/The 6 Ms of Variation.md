**Manpower, Machines, Measurements, Materials, Methods, and Mother Nature**

### Source

Variation in processes can stem from any of the six “M”s:

These are the sources of variation in all processes (manufacturing and anything else).

Examples:

## Manpower

- if workers are untrained, or have inherent differences in their capabilities or preferences

## Machine

- Machines may degrade over time, and have imperfect tolerances even at their best
- Different machines might run the same applications differently

## Mother Nature

- Weather affecting travel conditions
- Acts of God ruining materials in work (e.g. the roof caves in due to snow)

## Measurements

- Metrics chosen do not correlate to process success
- Measurement errors due to units or inherent uncertainty

## Method

- Variations in approach (e.g. waterfall vs agile, or drill press vs hand drill)

## Materials

- this load of bread went moldy before that one did, despite them having the same due date
