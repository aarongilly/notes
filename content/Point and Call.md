**A Japanese railroad innovation of pointing at and saying aloud all caution signs and signals. **

A Japanese railway company was experiencing more workplace accidents and mistakes than they wanted. They instituted a rule in which all railroad employees (conductors, etc) were to point at and read aloud all signals necessary to do their job safely and correctly. This included signals that ensured the doors were clear and the train was safe to proceed.

The company credits this innovation with reducing accidents by 85%.
