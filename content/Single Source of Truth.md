**A good thing to shoot for in business and any complicated system.**

When it comes to almost everything, it's best to have a single, authoritative source of truth (SSOT). The facts listed there are **defined** as the truth.

You can enable and supercharge your SSOT by using pointers and references, or even better by using [[Transclusion]]. This is what [[Data Normalization Levels]] are all about.

When you're considering a new metric, ensure you know where your data come from. When possible build directly from the SSOT.

Really the only example I can think of where this isn't true is the News. You should get your news from several places from several perspectives.
