**A good thing to shoot for in business and any complicated system.**

When it comes to almost everything, it's best to have a single, authoritative source of truth (SSOT). The facts listed there are **defined** as the truth. 

You can enable and supercharge your SSOT by using pointers and references, or even better by using [[Transclusion]]. It's best practice for reports to provide traceability to their source.

Picking your SSOT is an example of [[Make the Decision that Informs all Subsequent Decisions]]. You say **this** is reality. **This** is what we will use. **This** is what we will defend.

When you're considering new [[Metrics]], ensure you know where your data come from. When possible build directly from the SSOT.

## Counter-Example
Really the only example I can think of where this isn't true is the News. You should get your news from several places from several perspectives.
