**Engineering → data & a right answer, design → no data, no "right" answer**

Design problems are when there aren't great data that can be taken and there is not going to be "one right answer". Engineering problems are for when you can use data to find "the" answer. Aesthetics are inherently a design problem, but there are far more design problems than that.
