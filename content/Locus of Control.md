**If you believe you are in control of your domain and life. **

The **Locus of Control** is a concept around where you feel the control for your life, circumstances, and the situation of the world and those around you lay. You can have either an Internal Locus, where you believe you are mostly able to control life, or an External Locus where you feel like basically nothing you do will have any real bearing or effect.  

## External Locus Traits

- More prone to depression
- Better at just doing their job and going home

## Internal Locus Traits

- More likely to succeed (in almost any measure)
- Less likely to be content in an overly simple or constrained job function
