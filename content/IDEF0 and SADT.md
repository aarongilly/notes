**SADT is a predecessor and superset of IDEF0**

IDEF0 was derived from another approach called “Structured Analysis & Design Technique” (SADT). SADT is a predecessor to and a superset of [[IDEF0]]. It was used by the Air Force in the 1970’s. SADT contains all of IDEF0, plus:

- Data modeling
    - which ties into the functions
- Some syntax features like 2-way arrows
- Quantification Labels (”Q-Labels”)
    - Binds quantifiable values to ICOM lines
- Activation Rules
    - Allow for simulation of models

SADT turns IDEF0 into a form of lightweight Pseudo [[SysML]]. However SADT (like IDEF0, unfortunately) seems to be almost completely abandoned.
