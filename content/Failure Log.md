**Keep a record of your failures, what caused them, look for patterns & ways to learn/grow.**

It may be worthwhile having a periodic check-in to your biggest failures. Each month or so, write down what your biggest failures where. What happened to cause them. 

What could you have done differently? 

What did you learn? 

Revisit this every month or so, see if you're failing to learn from your failures. If you see the same reasons for failing over and over, that's something to pay attention to.
