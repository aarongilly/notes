**Continually splitting [[focus]] out of habit, leaving you less in the moment.**

Continuous Partial Attention is a term coined in 1998 to refer to the state of being continually split-[[focus]], not so much with the explicit aim of "multi-tasking", but more wanting to "not miss out" on the latest news and conversation. The term seems to refer more to checking your phone while watching TV, and situations like that.

It makes it difficult to live in the moment â€£ and can increase stress.
