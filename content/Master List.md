**A list of lists to keep track of where you’re keeping track of things.**

Keep a list of pointers (links) to the various pieces of your Productivity Stack. This allows for both consistency and flexibility. As you move between platforms and projects, you can have a constant checklist to walk through in your periodic reviews.

## Example
- Tasks & Inbox → Todoist
- Knowledge Management → Obsidian
- Passwords → LastPass
- [[Weekly Review]] Template → Notion
- Medical Information → Google Drive "Medical" folder
- Quantified Self Data → Apple Health & FitBit

By putting them all down and in one place, you are forced to clarify their usage and purpose. If you've got tools installed that don't make it into your list, they're probably [[Clutter]].
