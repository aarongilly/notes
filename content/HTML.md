**The structure of the web.**

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an [[XML]]-like data serialization markup language that is used on the web. It's one-third of the main technologies that drive the web (see: [[HTML CSS JavaScript]])

For now, I'm not going to cover anything more specific than that. It's a topic about which I could dive *very* deeply.
