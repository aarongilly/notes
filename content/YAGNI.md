**“You Aren’t Going to Need It” - develop what’s needed now, not what you think you’ll need.**

YAGNI = a slogan of “Extreme Programming”.

> Don’t build flexible components and frameworks for the first case that may need them. Let those structures grow as they are needed.

This makes for better [[Agile]] work. You can deliver the feature faster. You have less chance of having built a complex thing that will not be needed due to future requirements changes.

> [!tldr] 👉 Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Simple design is better that complex. See the [[The Zen of Python]].

In my experience, when re-writing the [[PDW]], I built in a lot of “pre-planned” functionality that wound up becoming totally unnecessary (and deleted) later on.
