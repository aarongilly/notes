**Getting tunnel vision when you're suddenly switched to a state of high engagement.**

When you go from a disengaged state to a state of arousal, *you focus on the most obvious stimuli* right in front of you... even if that's not the right thing to [[focus]] on. This happens more and more with the increased levels of automation. When the autopilot fails, the human pilot may not be as prepared as we'd like him to be. This effect is lessened by those with strong [[Mental Models]].
