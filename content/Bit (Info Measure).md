**1 bit = IDs 1/2 of all results **

When you have a sample population to make a random selection from, 1 bit of information is enough to cut that population in half.

2 bits cuts your possibilities in half *twice*. 

3 bits cuts your possibilities in half 3 times. 

The general formula for bits of information is:

$$
(1/2)^I=p
$$

Where “I” is information, measured in bits, and “p” is the probability of a random selection being identifiable.
