**sleep – a consistent seven- to nine-hour opportunity each night – is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health**

Lack of sufficient sleep...

- Is one of the leading environmental factors for developing Alzheimer’s Disease
- Makes it harder to remember things even in the more near-term
- Makes you more moody and retards the ability to control impulses
- Causes the hormone that controlled your hunger to go haywire, causing you to overeat
- Aerobic and anaerobic capacities are both diminished by measurable margins
- Athletes that sleep 9 hours a night are injured half as often as those who sleep 5-6.
- Increases likelihood of developing cancer, heart disease, and diabetes
    - Daylight savings days see swings of 20+% above and below baseline rates of heart attacks.
