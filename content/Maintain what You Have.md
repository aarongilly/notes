**Maintain your stuff to maximize its value and utility**

We try to take care of ourselves, but this maintenance mindset should extend to our stuff. Taking care of things will also curtail acquiring too many things to take care of.

**Examples:**

Get your oil changed and tires rotated

Change your air filters 

Drain your hot water heater annually
