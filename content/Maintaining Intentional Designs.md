Good design is vulnerable to *rot*. Unconstrained/uncoordinated acquisitions/additions, will erode the key benefits of your design, whether it be in the realm a *business EA design*, *application design*, *interior design*, or *life design*. You don't have the luxury of going and doing "whatever", and ending the day with something as [[Cohesion|cohesive]] and workable as you started. As you add moveable elements, you add points of friction and failure. Maintaining [[Conceptual Integrity]] is **not** just a coding practice, it's a continual one in any arena you have to maintain. What changes you choose to make, and most crucially what *new components* you choose to add must be in alignment with the design decisions you've made, or they will add complexity. [[Simple is Maintainable]]. Good design means having [[A Place for Everything]], and that everything make sense in the place it is. Runaway additions, *especially* those made by multiple people, will result in a big mess. You need to be confident and well-practiced in using [[A Firm & Polite “No”]].

### Examples
- When it comes to [[Enterprise Architecture]], you must consider your [[Project-to-Architecture Linkage]].
- When it comes to life design, it should be [[Hell Yes or No]].
- When it comes to coding projects, sometimes [[Worse is Better]].
- When it comes interior design, I'm not really qualified. Probably have less stuff, though.
