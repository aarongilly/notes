[[SysML]] V2 is, like [[OPM]], bi-modal. With textual and graphical notations. Unlike OPM, the SysML Textual notation is much more Java-like and much less English-like. 

SysML V2 is big. The SysML V2 Specification is apparently bigger than V1 + the relevant parts of the UML Spec. 

SysML V2 is a graph now, where relationships are "Reified" into model elements themselves as part of the standard. They are a first class citizen and can now be easily represented with a [[Graph Database]].
