**Most decisions we make aren't made with the "thinking" mind.**

## Emotional Decisions

A vast majority of the things we decide to do are governed by [[Emotional Algorithms]]. When we decide to eat. Whom we decide to marry. Pretty much everything decision that isnâ€™t an intentional, rationalized choice is made not because of the facts themselves, but how you feel about the facts.
