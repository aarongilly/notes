**Making small progress consistently towards a goal will result in long teen wives.**

You don‚Äôt need to take huge steps to make huge progress. Small steps **in a consistent direction** will take you anywhere. [[Prefer a Long-Term Philosophy]]. The smallest thing that pushes you toward your goals is called "**Minimum Viable Progress**".

Small and simple wins in essential areas are huge. Much bigger than large flashy initiatives in the wrong areas, or those that are doomed to fail. In order to make progress, start small. Make small improvements in things you do often. Repeat those improvements. Iterate on them. Eventually you'll hit a breakthrough, and it will seem like an overnight success ([[Valley of Disappointment]]).

Every day do something that moves you closer to your goals. This is also called the ‚Äú**no zero**‚Äù philosophy.

Minimum Viable Progress can be made via the [[Pomodoro Technique üçÖ ]] and/or [[Time Blocking]]
