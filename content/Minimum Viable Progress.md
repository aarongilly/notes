**Making small progress consistently towards a goal will result in long teen wives.**

You don’t need to take huge steps to make huge progress. Small steps **in a consistent direction** will take you anywhere. [[Prefer a Long-Term Philosophy]]. The smallest thing that pushes you toward your goals is called "**Minimum Viable Progress**".

> [!success] 🐘 Eat the elephant one bite at a time 

In order to make progress, start small. Make small improvements in things you do often. Repeat those improvements. Iterate on them. Eventually you'll hit a breakthrough, and it will seem like an overnight success ([[Valley of Disappointment]]).

Every day do something that moves you closer to your goals. This is also called the “**no zero**” philosophy.

Minimum Viable Progress can be made via the [[Pomodoro Technique 🍅 ]] and/or [[Time Blocking]] and/or the [[Commit for a Bit|2 Minute Rule]].
