**Not all checklists are flat lists of boxes to be ticked... see: Gantt Charts, Templates, etc.**

Not all [[Checklists]] look like simple, flat lists of boxes to be ticked. Those certainly have their place, but sometimes you can fulfill the purpose of a checklist *and then some* with these alternative forms of checklists:

## Simple Checklist

A simple set of boxes to be ticked. These are incredibly powerful. The more well honed a checklist is, the better. Sort of like: [[Small and Essential   Big but Inessential]], also [[Small but Consistent beats Big but Sporadic ]].

## Templates

A template is essentially a checklist that includes structure and some starting content. Templates are great and should be used wherever possible to speed up anything you do repeatedly. [[Notion]] offers great template support. Look for ways to make a template out of your routine tasks.

## Gantt Charts

Gantt Charts (and, more generally, schedules) are checklists of tasks to be completed in a certain order. Their graphical depiction may be very different from a simple checklist, but that’s essentially how they function.
