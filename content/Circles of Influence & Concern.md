**Be aware of the domains you care about, and those where you have impact.**

Each of us has a **circle of influence** - those things which we can impact, and a **circle of concern** - those things which we care about.

If your circle of concern has a large non-overlapped portion with your circle of influence, you aren't in control.

Learn which is which, and focus more on your **circle of influence**. In doing so, it will grow.

You'll never have full overlap. The goal is to minimize that disconnect, and to make peace with what you care about, but cannot influence.
