**Emoji serve a similar purpose to gestures.**

From a functional perspective - emoji fulfill a very similar role in chat-based conversations as gestures do in real-world in-person conversations.

They carry some semantic meaning, but not much. They, however, can provide great context to the words that are used. 

`I had fun ðŸ˜„.` is very different than `I had fun ðŸ˜´.`

The smiley face :-) was invented as a suggestion to prevent sarcastic messages from being taken seriously.
