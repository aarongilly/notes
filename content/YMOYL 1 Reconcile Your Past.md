**Find out how much you've earned in your lifetime**

Step 1 of [Your Money or Your [[Your Money or Your Life]] is really 2 things:

1. Find out how much money you've earned in your entire life
2. Find out what the value of all the stuff you own is

The goal is to see what you've had available to you and what you've managed to turn it into.

Find out your net worth. This includes doing a comprehensive inventory of everything you own, assigning a current value (what you'd expect to sell it for at a garage sale or online), and all outstanding debts.
