Modeling tools used for systems ([[SysML]]), functions ([[IDEF0]]), processes ([[IDEF3]], [[BPMN]]), and [[Enterprise Architecture]]s ([[UAF]], [[Archimate]]) could be used as a framework for a company’s knowledge base/[[Semantic Wikis]]. This approach offers a number of advantages to exploit and, similarly, drawbacks to mitigate.

## Advantages 
- scalability due to
	- [[Referential Integrity]]
	- Enforced constraints
	- Model validation mechanisms
- in-built [[Ontology, Semantics, and Syntax|Semantics]] 
- modularity - the same model may be used to produce numerous types of outputs (e.g. .docx, .html) based on numerous types of views of the same underlying model
- special tool-specific features may be used
	- simulation 
	- code generation

## Disadvantages 
- modeling tools aren’t designed to be knowledge bases, you’re working against your tools
- modeling languages’ [[Ontology, Semantics, and Syntax|syntax]] aren’t user friendly
- modeling tools are not good for presentation, and require either mass installation or the utilization of reporting

### Mitigations
- **Reporting** - essentially every modeling tool has reporting mechanisms. Good ones have *good* reporting mechanisms. These are, however, still less easy than simply
