*Note: this note is not About "rituals" in the way that OCD sufferers use the word.*

Rituals seem like a good way to interject "just enough" [[Structure Enables Improvement|structure]] into a life. Rituals are nothing other than a "chunk" of behavior undertaken on some frequent basis. Rituals could be triggered through environmental cues or scheduled. Rituals are perhaps just a slightly more 'formal' way of characterizing [[Foundational Habits]]. Rituals are essentially [[Other Forms of Checklist#Templates|Templates]] of behavior.

They seem like a good idea for both *personal* and *interpersonal* use cases. You could have your own little rituals, or ones undertaken by your group to facilitate [[Human Synchrony]]. In these cases, it may not come as "naturally" to create & use rituals, but perhaps they should be (from time to time) manufactured.

They quite literally can be enabled through the intentional use *of* templates. They can be established through [[Contextual Reminders]] and/or [[Implementation Intentions]].

Rituals can be crafted to "bake in" best practices and the principles upon which you want to act. They can be used as [[Habit Stacking]] mechanisms. 
### Example Rituals

- [[Weekly Review]]
- [[Scrum#Ceremonies|Scrum Ceremonies]]
- Fitness Tests
#### Environment Driven
