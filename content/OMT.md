Object Management Technique is a method for modeling systems (mostly software) that I hadn’t heard of before. It was developed at General Electric by a dude named James Rumbaugh. OMT is about **Object-Oriented Design**. It features primarily (maybe _only_):
	- Class Diagrams - _structure_
	- State Chart Diagrams - _behavior_
	- Data Flow Diagrams - _functional_
