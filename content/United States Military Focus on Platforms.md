**The US Military Focuses on small numbers of large platforms, which could be problemtic.**

[[Christian Brose]] points at our preoccupation with “Military Platforms” - multi-million (or multi-billion) dollar platforms which represent certain mission functionality (e.g. Aircraft Carriers, types of planes, or subs, or tanks) - is getting in the way of a focus on being able to effectively win a war. Having good cards in your hand doesn't mean you will win the game. He argues we should instead focus on improving our ability to execute [[The Kill Chain]]. This is also us thinking the only way to get better is to improve our existing stuff, rather than take a fresh look at what’s possible.

### Drone Swarms vs Battleships

A fleet of 1000 drones, each costing $1M could probably consistently outfight a battleship costing multiple billions. Small numbers of large, expensive platforms will lose against large numbers of more modestly priced intelligent, mostly autonomous machines.
