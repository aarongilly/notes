Your [[Attentional Space]] refers to those few things that your **Conscious Mind** is aware of. However, even though *it* is not seeing what's not coming through the [[Attentional Filter]], you've got another suite of sensors running at all times.

> [!tip] Your body and your subconscious are constantly taking in information, and your unconscious mind is *fully capable* of learning.

This phenomenon was referred to in [[Blink]] as the "[[Adaptive Unconscious]]". Your body is capable of recognize situations sometimes *before* your conscious mind. It will send signals to the mind. As a matter of fact, it's *probably* the thing that's causing you "feel" a certain way. In essence, your cheeks aren't hot and blood pressure up because you're mad - you're mad because your cheeks are hot and blood pressure is up.

## How to Use
It's difficult to know "when" you should use your *body* to make the call, rather than your head. There's probably no way to articulate it aside from the obvious things (e.g. if you're on the fence anyway and/or if you're bodily reaction is quite strong). But one thing you *can* do is **try to pay extra attention to the signals in your body** when you're making a decision, and marry those up with the outcome of your choice. [[The Extended Mind]] went so far as to suggest writing down descriptions of your [[Interoception]], then returning to the paper after the outcome is known.

#### The Fake Coin Toss
This reminds me of the trick I learned in high school or college - if you're on the fence about something, toss a coin. 

Heads you leave.  
Tails you stay. 

You flip the coin and look at the result, and only then does it become clear what you wanted the result to be all along. Go with what you wanted.

#### Use [[Interoceptive Shuttling]]
See that note.
