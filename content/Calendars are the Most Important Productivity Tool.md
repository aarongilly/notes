summary: The humble calendar is the king of the Productivity Tools
---
The humble calendar is the king of the productivity tools. It's a [[Maps|map]] of [[Time is the Universal Index|time]] with a clear, obvious, and universally shared understanding of how the system functions. Calendars are **the most important thing** to manage when it comes to **the most important** of your [[3 Personal Resources]]. They're simple, and [[Simple is Maintainable]].

Calendars are the structure for [[Periodic Reviews]]. They can provide [[Contextual Reminders]] to do things like reach [[Inbox Zero]] or perform periodic [[Maintain what You Have|Maintenance]]. They can also surface relevant [[Checklists]] and [[Intermediate Packets|templates]]. They make [[Time Blocking]] possible, allowing you to suggest to your future self how to utilize your time (or even *how much time* through the use of [[Timeboxing]]). They keep your [[Task Manager]] bound to *reality* - you need X done by Y date. When it comes to managing tasks, calendars are better for [[Deadlines and Due Dates|Deadlines]] than "do dates". They crystalize *who* is doing *what*, *when*; which is the absolute key to interpersonal cooperation. The calendar is the lifeblood of working successfully with others[^1]. It says who's doing what, when. It sets pace and provides the heartbeat of the organization - even if the organization is you and your spouse.

Note: while calendars *can* be used to hold tasks and [[Note Types|Meeting Notes]] *directly*, they're not the best mechanism for those things. Task managers and dedicated notes apps are better.

[^1]: Except those few companies or endeavors that can truly be done asynchronously.
