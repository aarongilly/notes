**Five steps to walk thru, in order. **

Elon Musk’s 5 Step Engineering Protocol - to be applied IN ORDER.

1. Make the requirements less dumb
    
    Question them. They are dumb. Find out how and see if they can be made less dumb. 
    
2. Try to remove the part or step
    
    **Complexity is the enemy.** If you're not adding things back in 10% of the time you're not removing often enough.
    
3. Simply of Optimize
    
    Only after removing what you can and making the requirements less dumb.
    
4. Accelerate cycle time
    
    Once you've done all of the above… do the process faster. 
    
5. Automate
    
    After getting a smooth, logical, non-error-prone process running, remove in-process testing and manipulation
