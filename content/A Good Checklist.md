**Some basic rules for making a checklist good.**

A good [[Checklists]] is more likely to be used than a bad checklist. Using a checklist is the whole point, so aim to make yours good by following these basic rules.

- Have clear starting points when the checklist should be used. (i.e. [[Implementation Intentions]])
- Are intentionally made to be either “do confirm” checklist (checking after the face) or “read do” checklist (like a recipe) ([[Read, Do or Do, Confirm]])
- Keep it to 5-9 items. Don't be too strict on this. ([[~7 - The Limit of Simultaneous Info]])
- Keep the checklist to 60 to 90 seconds to run through. Focus on the Killer items, those vital steps that sometimes get missed  ([[2 Minute Rule of Habits]])
- Wording should be exact and use the language of the profession. It should not be vague, but it shouldn't be overly prescriptive.
- A checklist should fit on one page and not be cluttered with extra imagery or colors.
- Checklists need to be tested, and need to be revised as they are run and things are learned.

Remember: **Checklists are not meant to be comprehensive how-to guides.** They are quick and simple checks to help skilled people who already know what they are doing.
