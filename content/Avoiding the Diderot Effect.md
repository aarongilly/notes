**6 tips to avoid spirals of consumption**

# Mastering the [[Diderot Effect]]

James Clear offers these tips for mastering the Diderot Effect and avoiding a spiral of consumption that leads to no real gain.

1. [[Remove Ads from Your Life]] 
2. Buy items that fit your current systems
3. Set self-imposed limits (I won't spend more than $X on upgrades)
4. One in, One out - give away one old thing for each new thing you get (a tenet of [[Minimal Stuff]])
5. Go a month without buying something new
6. Let go of the want. They are wants, not needs.
