**Learn a subject better by teaching it to a child.**

> If you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough
> - *nobody actually knows, it's often misattributed to Einstein*

Not developed by Richard Feynman, but was developed to emulate how he approached things.

The primary objective of the **Feynman Technique** is to learn about a subject by teaching it to children, **being concise and using simple words**.

## The Feynman Technique for Learning a Subject

1. Write down all that you know about it
2. Rewrite it as if you were explaining it to a child
    - Children have small vocabularies. Remove [[Avoid Jargon|jargon]]. Put it as simply as possible, but no simpler. Create & utilize accessible analogies.
    - Children have short attention spans. Say what’s important. Then get out.
3. Look for gaps in your knowledge
    - Where do you have to make jumps in your explanations?
    - These areas warrant further research.
4. Tell your story. 

## Why Learn by Teaching to Children?

Teaching to a child forces you to break down complexity. You cannot hide behind big vocabulary words. You have to truly understand a topic to be able to adequately teach it to a child. When you break things down far enough and try to weave them into a story, you’ll find gaps in your understanding. These gaps are your jump off points for further research.

## My Implementation of the Technique

I realized today that [http://www.aarongilly.com/gillespedia](http://www.aarongilly.com/gillespedia) is just an implementation of the Feynman technique.
