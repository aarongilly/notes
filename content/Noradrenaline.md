**`= this.summary`**

Looks like Noradrenaline and [[Adrenaline]] are almost the same. Chemically they are almost the same and functionally they are almost the same. 

One thing that Noradrenaline can do that regular adrenaline does not do is constrict your blood vessels and increase your blood pressure.
