**A buzzword, arguably shouldn't exist. **

The cynical nature of this note is from me.

“Industry 4.0” is a term for when an industry is put on steroids via a deep and robust usage of IOT, big data, and machine learning to enable new levels of production efficiencies and throughput. 

This doesn't feel distinct enough (to me) from the “3.0” revolution that was simply “computers start to automate physical and logical processes”.
