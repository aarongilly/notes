**In the interpersonal realm, satisficing is not a great policy.**

[[Satisficing]] is a great technique to use in the interpersonal realm. This is or two reasons, typically baked-into satisficing recommendations:

1. You're the one dealing with the less-than-perfect results
2. The less-than-perfect results are in unimportant areas

It is for both reasons that satisficing is a bad call in most interpersonal arenas. People can tell when you're not giving them your best. Not helping them isn't helping them, but it's also not helping your relationship. It would be often times better to give a [[A Firm & Polite “No”]] than to transparently half-heart your effort.
