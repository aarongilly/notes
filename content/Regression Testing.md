**Reducing scatter plots to a coherent function via MSE.**

Multiple regression testing is a method to derived which **weights** for a weighted average produces the minimum Mean Squared Error. How to perform MRT wasnâ€™t covered in the text. Guess and check seems like a fine enough approach to begin with. Calculus if you want, sure.

Regression testing is a technique in which a scatter plot of data can be reduced to a single function approximating the scatter. This is done using the Mean Squared Error ([[MSE]]) technique. Whatever function produces the minimal MSE is the best function... and the size of the minimum MSE is an indicator of system variability (aka [[Noise]]).
