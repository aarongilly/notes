In the same order they are presented in the [[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]]:
1. Don't assume the original statement of the problem is the best, or even right one. (this is similar to [[The XY Problem]])
	1. The hidden assumptions are usually the most damaging (the [[Unknown Unknowns]])
	3. The customer knows what they want, but not what they need.
2. In the early stages of a project, unknowns are a bigger issue than known problems
3. Model before build, wherever possible
4. Most serious mistakes are made early on
