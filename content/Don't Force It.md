**Don't "force results" to happen. Set up situations that enable them to be more likely to happen.**

A recurring theme in my reading, watching, and life happenstances is that *trying to force results* is almost always a bad idea. It is better to setup an environment, goal set, and process that *best enables results to happen*. This doesn't mean you get less done, it instead *should* have the opposite effects. 

Trying to force results looks like:
- setting results-based action plans
- not responding to resistance
- "pushing through" what shouldn't be

Enabling results looks like:
- setting effort-based action plans ([[Fix Time, Flex Scope]])
- focusing on the process itself ([[Right Process ⇒ Right Results]])
- reacting to resistance, finding new ways
- recognizing when something isn't working 
- being satisfied by setting up the result, whether or not it comes out ([[Love the Process]])
## Trying to Force It
Trying to force results leads to:
- **Frustration** - when you don't get the result you want
- **Dissatisfaction** - when you aren't accomplishing your goals due to external factors
- **Accidents & injuries** - taking shortcuts, cutting corners, or not listening to what the situation is telling you has lead to broken parts and bulging discs

## Enabling it to Happen
Try doing these things more.
- **Remove resistance** - don't rely on willpower to stay focused, use contextual reminders ([[Sharpen the Saw]], [[Tailor Your Environment]])
- **Prepare for traction** - don't start working haphazardly, have your bladder empty and the tools you need ready ([[Treat Work Sessions like the Cinema]])
- **Set internal goals** - aim for what cannot be blocked by external factors ([[External Goals vs Internal Goals]])
- **[[Focus]] on the process** - use [[Checklists]], think about what you're doing as you're doing it ([[Right Process ⇒ Right Results]])
