**Develop a bias for action over research.**

Your natural inclination is to use ‘Research’ as an excuse.

The best, fastest, most productive way to learn something is to try to do it. **You probably have [[enough]] knowledge already to get started.** Try the thing. If it doesn’t seem like it’s going well, *then* dive into pure research mode. 

Doing research upfront is often a [[Productive Distraction]]. Just do the thing. Keep it [[Simplicity|simple]].
