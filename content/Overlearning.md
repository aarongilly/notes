**The learning MORE than you need, so you will remember the bit you need.**

Overlearning is the conscious study of something you already know now, to entrain the neural pathways into long term memory. Overlearning is what separates your ability to repeat a nonsense phrase you just heard in 10 years. 

Another definition- Ultralearning is that math joke:
> You don't understand algebra until you take geometry.
> You don't understand geometry until you take calculus.
> You don't understand calculus until you take differential equations. 
> You never understand differential equations.

Overlearning can be applied to any realm of education or technique to further build it into your brain.
