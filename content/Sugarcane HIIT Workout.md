The Sugarcane [[HIIT]] workout is a highly efficient way to work on your [[VO2 Max]]. It's short, but brutal. It's a working set/rest protocol that can be applied to any workout that covers *distance* (running, rowing, biking). It consists of 3 rounds, with 2 minute rests in between.

## Steps
- Warm up.
- **Round 1:** sprint for 2 minutes. Maximum distance. 
- Rest for 2 minutes. Take note of distance covered in round 1.
- **Round 2:** sprint for *as long as it takes* to cover the same distance.
- Rest again for 2 minutes. Take note of the time taken in round 2.
- **Round 3:** sprint again for *as long as you took in Round 2*. Goal is to go as far as you did in round 1.
- Cool down

Whole thing can be done in ~10 minutes, plus warm-up/cool-down. ****
