**Your salary, minus working expenses, divided by hours worked + hours spent in service of work.**

## Your Real Hourly Wage

The standard, obvious calculation for your hourly wage would be how many dollars you make an hour (for hourly employees) or your annual salary divided by the number of working hours per year. It would look like this:

> [!tldr] 👉🏻 Standard Hourly Wage: 
Annual Salary / (50 weeks x 40 hours/week)

This doesn’t take into account expenses incurred in the name of your job (commuting gas & wear and tear on vehicle, a vehicle you wouldn’t otherwise need, clothing, various supplies), nor does it factor in the non-working work hours (commutes, off hour calls or emails).

> [!tldr] 👉🏻 Real Hourly Wage: 
(Annual Wage - Work Expenses) / (hours worked + hours spent in the service of work)
