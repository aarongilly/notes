**OKRs bring clarity, alignment, commitment, and accountability.**

### Focus

OKRs force you to decide what is important, and realize what's not. 

### Alignment

OKRs in an organization ensure a *common* [[focus]]. This is also known as alignment. Across an organization, aligning higher level Key Results with lower level Objectives ensure that the ground troops are working toward what the execs believe to be important.

### Commitment

Making your OKRs SMART and public is a show of commitment. Continually reviewing progress against them (see the next section) renews this commitment.

### Tracking

OKRs are to be checked in with frequently. Key results are number-based, and in being so, measurable. The timeline of the goal provides a clear domain of measure.
