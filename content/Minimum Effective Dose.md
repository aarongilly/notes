**Do the minimum to achieve the effect you need.**

Minimum Effective Dose is a concept from the world of medicine. To treat illness doctors prescribe drugs. Drugs, however, come with undesired side-effects. A recurring pattern happens as your increase the dose of most medicines... treatment efficacy degrades (due to the [[Law of Diminishing Returns]]) whole the negative impacts of side-effects continue to increase. The best way to combat this issue is to **utilize the smallest possible dose to achieve the desired result**. 

This same exact concept can be utilized to lead a more productive, more efficient lifestyle. When applied to working on Projects, minimum effective dose becomes [[Minimum Viable Progress]].
