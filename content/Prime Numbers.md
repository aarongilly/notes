**Numbers >1 that are only divisible by themselves and 1.**

Prime numbers are the building blocks of other numbers. All numbers that are not prime can be reduced down until they are specific and unique sets of prime numbers multiplied together. This is called “Prime Factorization”.

Numbers that are *not* prime are called [[Composite Numbers]].

There is an infinite number of prime numbers. They never stop.
