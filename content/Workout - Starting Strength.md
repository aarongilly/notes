**Mark Rippetoe’s Infamous Routine**

Weight training legend Mark Rippetoe's book "Starting Strength" outlines this routine. I have not (yet) read it, unfortunately. My reverence for it comes through aggregation of citing through multiple sources & media.

# Phase 1 - Beginners

3x a week. ABA → BAB.

## Day A

1. [[Bench Press]] 3x5
2. [[Squat]] 3x5
3. [[Deadlift]] 1x5

## Day B

1. [[Bench Press]] 3x5
2. [[Overhead Press]] 3x5
3. [[Deadlift]] 1x5

Do this literally as you're **starting** to develop your strength. It's a **beginner's** routine.

# Phase 2 - Novice

Same as Beginners routine, except Day B will end with [[Power Clean]] 5x3 instead of Deadlifts 1x5.

# Phase 3 - "Advanced Novice"

Same as Beginners routine, except Day A will end with either Deadlift or Power Clean (alternate between "Day A" workouts). And Day B will end with Chin-ups.
