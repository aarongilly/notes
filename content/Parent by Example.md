**Who we are & how we engage with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children will do than how much we know about parenting.**

Children invariably grow up to be a lot like their parents. Therefore, if you want your child to have the best relationship possible with stressors, fears, and obstacles that will inevitably come their way - the best thing you can do for the child is learn how to engage with those things in a healthy & effective manner. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ Be the kind of person you want your kid to grow up to be.

Who we are and how we engage with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children will do than what we know about parenting.

You shouldn't try to take pain away from your child's life. It's a full part of living. You should be there empathetically to help them learn to feel it and know that failure and pain and sadness are temporary.
