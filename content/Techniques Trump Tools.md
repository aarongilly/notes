**Techniques are timeless and carry more impact than any given tool.**

It is better to rely on well-founded, **tool-independent** **techniques** than to be dependent on one tool. Tools come and go. Techniques are durable. Techniques are timeless. Techniques serve your needs uniquely, instead of serving you what the tool designer thinks you need.

## Example

- Anything can be an "inbox". You don't need a specific tool.
- A [[weekly review]] can be performed in any number of tools, or just by going through a mental checklist once/week.
