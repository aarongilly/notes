aliases: GCF

**Abbreviated "GFC", it's looking at two numbers and finding the largest of their factors.**

I mostly made this note so that I didn't forget that 'GFC(36, 99)' means "the greatest common factor of 36 and 99".

It's 3, by the way.
- 36: factors are `[1, 3, 6, 12]`
- 99: factors are `[1, 3, 9, 11, 33]`

Note this is using factorization, **not prime factorization**.
