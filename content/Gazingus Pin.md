**Any item you always buy, mostly out of habit.**

A Gazingus Pin is any item you buy over and over, despite not really needing or using. Thing you like to collect, even though there's really no need for them and they don't really add much to your life.

## Examples

- Shoes
- Organizational tools (for me)
- Kids toys
- Techno gadgets
