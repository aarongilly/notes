**The Quantified Self category of ongoing capture.**

This is the [[Lifelogging]] category of ongoing capture. As events occur in your day-to-day life, they are captured and recorded via means and into locations according to your [[Data Manifest]]. Capturing these logs should be automated wherever possible both to free up your mind and to keep you honest.
