**3-to-6 months’ expenses, saved for emergencies.**

An Emergence Fund is a fairly liquid chunk of assets (e.g. Savings Account) that can be called upon to cover you in the case of emergencies (car breaks down, AC goes out, break a leg). The size of your emergency fund is based on your [[Burn Rate]].

Most sources I’ve read peg a good emergency fund goal at between 3 and 6 months’ living expenses. That is - enough to cover your absolute necessities. This is not *necessarily* equal to your burn rate, or even your [[Budget]], but what those things could be reasonably brought down to without sacrificing too much. Basically you don’t need to include your monthly $200 donation to whatever charity in your emergency fund… just stop making that donation in the case of an emergency.
