**Doing something only to get a result is a less-than-desirable experience.**

Anything that is done in pursuit of a "result" will take you out of the moment if you are not careful. It's hard to be here and now when you were doing some thing **only** to get an effect. Working only as a means to an end almost by definition destroys any semblance of [[Mindfulness & Now]].

Doing something because you enjoy it ([[Intrinsic Motivation]]) is a great way to enjoy the here and now, and if it just so happens to net some result that's desirable that's a doubly-good thing.

As James Clear says: [[Love the Process]]
