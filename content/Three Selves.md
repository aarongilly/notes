**Anticipating, Experiencing, and Remembering**

We have three selves, the anticipating self, the experiencing self, and the remembering self. The anticipating and remembering self activate the same regions of the brain. Thus, anticipating an event is very similar to remembering it. Often when it comes to making decisions about what to do, we only pay attention to our ‘experiencing self’. That’s the one who’s tired, and worrying about logistics.

“We pamper the present like a spoiled child.”
