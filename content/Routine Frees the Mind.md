**Once behaviors are automatic, you can accomplish things and keep a free mind.**

Habits are powerful, not only because they enable consistent performance and [[Habits Have Compounding Returns]], but also because it enables an individual to perform important and/or necessary tasks without having to think about it. This frees the mind to continue working on things more important and satisfying things than: 

"okay, next I need to open the cabinet where I keep the coffee"...
"okay, I need to get the grinder out"...
"okay, I need to take the lid off" ...

You do all those things automatically while you think about where you want to go on your next vacation, or solve a work problem thatâ€™s been bothering you.

**Routine enables difficult things to become easy. Soon you can autopilot the accomplishment of one essential task while devoting the mind to work on the next essential thing.** Doing the same things the same way every time enables you to maintain standards of performance and avoid [[Decision Fatigue]].  It enables [[Multichannel Multitasking]]. 

Be careful to stop and smell the roses every so often. [[Results are not Presence]]. Don't fill your day executing routines only to go to sleep not being sure where the day went.
