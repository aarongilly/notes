**The optimal spot of work is just on the bleeding edge of your capabilities.**

When performing mental or physical tasks, the optimal spot to aim for is just barely beyond of your comfort zone. You want to be performing at peak or near peak capacities. This brings about work that is enjoyable, avoids burnout, and improves your performance the most over time. [[Flow]] is most often found in this state.

## If you aim too low ⬇️😑

- You aren't making yourself better
- You are producing an inferior product
- You'll get bored

## If you aim too high ⬆️😰

- You are likely to get overwhelmed
- You are more likely to quit
- Ultimately, you won't make progress

James Clear called this "The Goldilocks Rule".
