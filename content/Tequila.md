**Margarita Juice - from the Blue Agave plant**

Apparently all Tequila is from Blue Agave. That's what makes it Tequila.

## Tequila Cocktails
### Margarita
According to the IBA - it's 50ml tequila, 20ml triple sec, and 15 ml lime juice
...or a thing I made
2 oz blanco tequila
1/2 oz orange liquor (e.g. triple sec)
1 oz lime juice
1/2 oz agave syrup (I used nectar, was great)
Salt that rim. Lime if you got it.
