**For organizing, it's best to have good labels. It's worst to have wrong labels.**

For organizing, it's best to have good labels. It's worst to have wrong labels.

Unlabeled things are okay. Mislabeled things are not. They are truly lost. Worse, they make you not trust the labels that do exist.

If you find something that's mislabeled, and you don't know how it should be labeled, it's better to remove the label.
