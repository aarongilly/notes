**Vulnerability is a part of living, and its where growth, joy, and love all live.**

Vulnerability comes for you, no matter who you are or what you do. It's a necessary part of living. It is where growth, learning, joy, and love all come from. Being vulnerable is being **alive**. Nobody is more vulnerable than the man who is the MOST alive.

Vulnerability between those working together on teams is directly tied to the quality of output of the team. See: [[Psychological Safety]]
