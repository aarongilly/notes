**5 principles for Object-Oriented Programming**

## SOLID is an acronym for:
### Single-Responsibility
> [!success] ðŸ‘‰ A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
    
### Open-closed
> [!success]  ðŸ‘‰ Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    
### Liskov Substitution
 > [!success] ðŸ‘‰ Every subclass should be substitutable for the base or parent class
    
### Interface Segregation
 > [!success] ðŸ‘‰ A class shouldnâ€™t be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use or depend on methods it doesnâ€™t use
    
### Dependency-Inversion
 > [!success] ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t have a class depend explicitly on another class, have an abstract interface between them
    
This last one seems weird.
