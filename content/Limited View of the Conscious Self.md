**Your conscious isn't the Oval Office, it's the Press Office.**

Our [[Internal Narrator]] has a very limited view of your whole self. Your consciousness is not in the oval office it's in the press office it's just trying to explain what the Oval Office is doing.

In split brain patients, the speaking half of people’s brains would come up with plausible explanations for reasons why they did things that only the right half of their brain was aware of. 

Your consciousness is a flashlight trying to find the dark in a dark room.
