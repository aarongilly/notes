**A desire to constantly scratch the novelty itch of new and different things causes great ecological harm.**

The desire for “more” is not only a [[Hedonic Treadmill]] of unhappiness, it contributes to the consumption patterns that are causing global ecological harm. We are the most affluent society that has ever existed, and yet we are not happy. If everyone in the world consumed like we do in the US we would need 4 Earths to sustain ourselves. 

**Earth Overshoot Day** is the the annual day in which we have used up the “sustainable” amount of Earth for that year. It happens earlier and earlier each year. If everyone could settle for "[[Enough]]" we'd have a much brighter future AND we'd be better off now, too.
