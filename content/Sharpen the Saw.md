**Take time to new your physical, spiritual, mental, and social well being.**

Habit 7 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Sharpen the Saw

I don't like the name for this habit. It is about continuous improvement and maintaining the four aspects of a person: the physical, spiritual, mental, and social. 

> [!tldr] ⚠️ You should take time to actively and intentionally renew yourself in each of these dimensions.

This is where you get into exercising and sleeping and eating well, meditating and partaking of great literature, studying and journaling, and to develop deep and meaningful relationships with others. Take an hour a day to work on yourself spiritually, physically, and mentally. Use habits 4, 5, and 6 to make and maintain good relationships. 

It is because of this that I do my 60-minute "me-time" routine each morning.

The difference between Sharpening the Saw and [[Unkink the Hose]] is that sharpening the saw is putting work into the think that helps you do work, even if the effort spent sharpening the saw isn't producing immediate results, it will produce more results in the long run. Unlinking the hose is just about removing obstacles rather than trying harder. Unlinking the hose is more general.
