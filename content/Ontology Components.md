- Classes (or "kinds")
    - A kind of thing that can have properties (nouns)
- Attributes
    - Properties that members of a class can have
- Relations
    - How classes or individuals can relate to others
- Restrictions
    - What must be true about something to be valid
- Rules/Axioms
    - Logical statements describing inferences that can be made
