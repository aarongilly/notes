**Ratio of caloric intake by fat/carbs/proteins**

One way to manage your diet is by paying attention to the macronutrients you are consuming. This serves as a bit of a middle ground between trying to balance every possible vitamin and mineral (I.e. micronutrients) and just doing nothing at all. There is a lot of study in this area and a lot of products and diets catering to it's different flavors. Diets focusing on macronutrient ratios of overall calorie consumption include Keto (in which Carbs are kept below ~5%, fats at ~75%, and proteins at 30%), the WFPB diet from T. Colin Campbell (wherein protein is kept around 10%, fats around 13%, and carbs making up the other ~77%), or, more generally a "IIFYM" (if it fits your macros) diet in which you choose whatever macronutrient target you want, then eat whatever you want *if it fits your macros*.
