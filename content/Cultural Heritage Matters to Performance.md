**Norms and constructs can pre-dispose certain peoples to higher chances of success or failure in different endeavors.**

The entire second half of the book [[Outliers]] can be summarized as what you look like, what language you speak, what your parents did for a living, what their parents did for a living, and what the societal norms are from wherever you’re from **do**
 affect your ability to succeed at certain tasks or in certain situations. The most vivid example was the example of the copilot from Korea who wasn’t comfortable speaking up to authority figures and thus allowed his plane to crash due to his lack of clear communication. This and stories like this are the entire second half of this book. I can’t stress that enough. The book isn’t that great.
