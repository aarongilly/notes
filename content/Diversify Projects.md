**It’s best to have multiple vastly different Projects going at any one time.**

It is best to have multiple, vastly different projects going at any one time. This way, when you’re stuck in one project, you have other avenues to continue making forward progress.

The way the brain works, sometimes you have to leave a Project for a while and let the unconscious mind sort through things. You will often come back to a Project with a new sense of clarity where you used to be stuck.

This works best if you have Projects that are sufficiently different. This also gives you opportunities to make serendipitous connections and bring information from one domain into another. See: [[Innovation Often is Remixing from Different Domains]]
