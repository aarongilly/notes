**It goes in forever. And there are different sizes of it. It's also the basis of calculus.**

Infinity is a weird concept. It's not a weird *number*, because infinity isn't really a number. It doesn't behave like a number. It doesn't obey the associative property. You can't add one to make it bigger. 

Some infinities are "countable" (e.g. all whole numbers) and some are "uncountable" (e.g. every irrational number between 0 and 1.

Infinity is almost more about how it is expressed than it is a number itself. Different expressions of infinity are "bigger" than others, despite them both being never ending. 

$n!\lim_{n\to\infty}$ is "more infinite" than just $n\lim_{n\to\infty}$.
