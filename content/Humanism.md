**A "Religion" in Yoval's words on human sanctity.**

The sole driving factor for what is good and bad, right and wrong, and what we all should be doing on a day to day basis used to be governed by the whims and wishes of deities. If a woman had an affair, she would wonder what demon has possessed her. Her belief would be that answer lies in the scriptures of whatever religion is in vogue. Iâ€™m modern times, we believe the only thing that can determine what is right and wrong is human feelings. What is bad about two loving men who choose to express their love physically? If they feel it is good, and them doing it does not make others feel bad, then it **is** good. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ Human feelings have become The arbiter of good and evil, right and wrong, and what is beautiful.
