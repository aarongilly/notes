A phrasing I've seen somewhere before for a minimalist's principle is simply "**hell yes, or no**". I've seen this rule of thumb given as "*a 90% fit or no*", but that doesn't have the same pizzaz.

> [!tldr] The Argument
> There are too many opportunities in the world to be filling your life and time with things that aren't an **ideal** fit or don't get you excited.

[[Principles are Verbs]]. This is a question you ask yourself when evaluating any new opportunity that comes your way that you might expend your [[3 Personal Resources]] on. If it takes time, money, or energy, then it should be evaluated. 

The idea is like the [[Jar of Rocks Issue]], there are too many rocks to fit into the jar, even when you've [[Put First Things First]] successfully. 

### Examples

- You don't have enough time to fill in your calendar with things that don't get you jazzed.
- You shouldn't have a closet stuffed to the brim with clothes you like. You should have a closet part way full with clothes you **love**.
- You shouldn't use your energy sitting on the couch, unless that's the "hell yes" for the moment. 

### Mechanisms

- Like almost everything regarding my philosophy of productivity, [[Time Blocking]] is a mechanism that could ensure those chosen few "hell yeses" are adequately represented in your calendar so they don't get crowded out by the trivial many.
- [[One In, One Out]] - don't let the stuff you have be crowded out by increasingly mediocre stuff. If you're getting something new, it needs to be better than something you already have such that you'll make the trade.

## Counter-Argument
This philosophy assumes you know yourself and what the world has to offer. You may not (and, in all likelihood, definitely won't) have *any* experience with those things that would turn out to be your new favorites. **Don't knock it till you've tried it.**
