**Similar, not the same**

[[Obsidian]] is a lot like Notion, minus the databases, but it runs locally. 

Notion’s better for highly dynamic stuff & project management stuff… but Obsidian may be better for [[PKM]].

Notion PKM Wins:
- Sync is not a concern
- Colorization is easier & callouts look better
- One fewer tools to have to learn
- Can make links available to anyone without hassle
- Saved views on the Database are nice

Obsidian PKM Wins:
- Faster
- Local & durable
- The graph view is neat
- [[Excalidraw]] works great
- Link previews on hover
- More customizable
- Can interact with code and regular file system operations
