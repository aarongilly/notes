**A quantified self map.**

A concept I've come up with independently (so far as I know).

A Data Manifest is a list of personal measures & metrics and the tools in which they are captured and stored. It [[Maps]] the various components together and forces the questions "why" am I capturing this data? "What" does it mean? "Where" does it live? "When" is it captured? and "How" am I going to use it?

## Example Datapoint Snippet

Sleep Duration

- Why - I believe consistently getting enough sleep enables better performance, increased happiness, and a better overall life.
- What - the period in which my wearable says I slept each night. Does not cover naps.
- Where - in my fitness app
- When - automatically via my sleep-tracking wearable
- How - I will review the sleep data nightly to determine if my habits need to change, and monthly to look for macroscopic trends.

## Example Tool Snippet

Oura Ring

- Integrates with Apple Health
- Covers sleep duration, [[naps]], bedtime & wake time, gross activity levels, and body temperature.
