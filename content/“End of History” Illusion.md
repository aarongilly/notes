**People tend to underestimate how much things will change in the future.**

If you put yourself in the mindset of who you were ~10 years ago, you realize just how much you’ve changed since then. Even knowing that, if you picture yourself in ~10 years, you inevitably picture someone who looks, thinks, and behaves a lot like you. This is a fallacy, an illusion.

> [!tldr] ➡️ You 10 years from now will be as different from you today, as you today are from the person you were 10 years ago.
