**Magical Medical Fun Money. Doubly-tax-incentivized.**

**Health Savings Accounts** (HSA) are magical medical fun money. You don’t have to pay income tax on whatever money you put into them, nor do you pay money on their growth - provided you’re using them for ‘qualifying medical expenses’. There are annual limits to how much you can contribute.

**HSAs are double-tax advantaged.** No taxes going in, no taxes coming out.

In order to have an HSA you must be enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Insurance Plan (HDHP) and *not* have medicare.
