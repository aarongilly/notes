**UML’s approach to flow chart.**

Activity Diagrams are graphical representations of behaviors (aka ‘activities’) that are linked together in some way to achieve some sort of result. Proper “Activity Diagrams” are a [[UML]] construct, that similar to [[IDEF3]] Process models. They borrow several conventions from ANSI/ISO’s spec for [[Flow Charts]] - including diamonds for decision nodes.

Example from Wikipedia

I find UML Activity Diagrams to be somewhat confusing, the “bar” notation for representing parallel splits & joins is too visually distracting.
