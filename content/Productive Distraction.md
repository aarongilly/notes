**Productive distraction is still distraction.**

You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it's distracting you from. [[Know Your Immediate Task]]. Things you traditionally wouldn't consider "distractions" can very much be a distraction if that's not what you planned to do. If you give up self-care time to work on Work, for example. Or the other way around. 

Avoiding productive distraction is one of the key benefits of [[Mental Time Blocking]]. You may also just be satisfying your need for [[Cognitive Closure]] rather than actually making progress on what's most important. See also: [[ Business is Laziness]].
