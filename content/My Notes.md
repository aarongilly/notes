**Meta note**

This is a store of permanent, [[Atomic Notes]]. They are meant to be portable and exportable. They are linked to each other and tagged with some basic tags.

I have decided not to include other people’s writing (beyond simple quotes) in this repository, because I don’t want other people’s writing to confuse my searches. If I search the pile, I want what comes up to be my take. 

These notes are also not meant to be [[Capturing Logs|logs]][^1]. They are meant to be [[Evergreen Notes]]. They do not record details about events of my life or particulars about things that aren't universal. Ideally these Notes would be of value to anyone who may stumble across them. If that's you, hi! How did you get these? I hope I'm not dead. If I am dead tell my family I love them.

It was [[Notion]]-based, but now lives here in [[Obsidian]]. If Obsidian ever gets dumb they can be fairly easily migrated to whatever else. 

## Structure

Each note has an opening paragraph that's typically bolded or otherwise called-out that should function as a *summary* of the note. There's [[Frontmatter]] containing some note meta-data - then the body, which you're looking at now. The body *may* be separated out into sections, but I try to limit that (due to atomicity). Finally, there are some standard sections at the bottom, each of which serve a purpose beyond what their title might suggest. **Source** is for looking up more stuff you may not have seen yet about the note (in addition to note *attribution*), and **Related Notes** is meant to be *more* than a collection of links that you could find in the body, but instead a more considered "here's what you could jump to next", more like a train of thoughts. If this were a true [[Zettelkasten Components|Zettelkasten]] this would be the index system (that alternates letters and numbers) that allows branches of thought to exist.

If I were to start from scratch, I'd probably **not include 'Related Notes'** on every note. Instead only including 'related notes' where they fell naturally. Things are tied together a bit too weakly right now (links don't mean quite as much). If they are related, say *how* they are related in the body. 

[^1]:My [[PDW]] is for that.
