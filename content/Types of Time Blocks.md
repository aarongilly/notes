There are many different ways to do [[Time Blocking]]. These are a few "types" of blocks, along with what it might look like in your calendar.

## Task-Specific Blocks

> 📅 Complete Project Review slides
> *Duration:* 30 minutes to 4 hours

Task-specific blocks are [[Timeboxing]] for specific activities. When something *needs* to get done, put it on your calendar & [[Make Time]] for it. 

## Frog Blocks

> 📅 🐸 Complete Project Review slides
> *Duration:* 1 to 3 hours

Frog Blocks are basically Task-Specific Blocks, where the task is the *hardest* task of the day, and the placement is **first thing** in your day. This is from the [[Eat the Frog]] method.
## Strategy Block

> 📅 Strategy
> *Duration:* 3 hours

A recommendation of the [[12 Week Year]] methodology, a "Strategy" block is time set out to *only* tackle tasks from your [[Plan of the Week]]. It's a strange name choice. 

## Buffer Block

> 📅 Catch Up
> *Duration:* 30 minutes to 1 hour

A recommendation of the [[12 Week Year]] methodology, Buffer blocks are where you catch up on email and miscellaneous to-dos. It's [[Task Batching]] your administrative stuff. These are times that you're working **broad**, which allows for the *rest* of your time to be spent working **deep**.

## Breakout Block

> 📅 Breakout
> *Duration:* 3 hours

A recommendation of the [[12 Week Year]] methodology, Breakout blocks are infrequent blocks scheduled during typical working times wherein you *don't* work. They suggest it will set you up for rejuvenation and whatnot... seems like it would just be stealing company time. I think the below is more appropriate.

## Planned Break

> 📅 Break
> *Duration:* 10 to 30 minutes

This is basically just a breakout block (above) that isn't crazy long. [[Scheduled Breaks]] are a good thing.
