**Signs indicating something yet to come. Opposite of [[Lagging Measures]].**

Leading measures are signs indicating something yet to come. They are valuable because they allow you to reasonably predict the future & give you a chance to affect a situation before some critical event may occur.

Leading measures are the opposite of [[Lagging Measures]], both are examples of [[Proxy Measures]].

## Example Leading Measures
