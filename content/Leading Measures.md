**Signs indicating something yet to come. Opposite of [[Lagging Measures]].**

Leading measures are signs indicating something yet to come. They are valuable because they allow you to reasonably predict the future & give you a chance to affect a situation before some critical event may occur.

Leading measures are the opposite of [[Lagging Measures]], both are examples of [[Proxy Measures]].

## Example Leading Measures

- Quantity and severity of fights in a relationship may be a leading measure of the end of the relationship.
- Hours studied are a leading measure of exam grades.
