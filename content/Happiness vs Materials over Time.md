**We are less happy than our ancestors, despite having materially much better lives.**

We live in easily the most affluent, well-off, provided-for, comfortable society that's ever existed - yet we're less satisfied with life (on average) than our grandparents. A heavy majority of those who wake up today in first-world countries can expect to have a roof over their heads, protection from the elements and most natural nuisances, enough food (typically much better food than was possible 100 years ago), and access to the infinite vastness of entertainment & conveniences - yet the average "happiness" hasn't grown.

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ We've improved our material powers 1000x, but made almost no advancement in terms of improving the content of experience.

## Example: United States 1960 vs 1984

Summary of our "progress" over that period of time.

- Poverty Rate: basically the same
- Violent Crimes per Capita: rose 300%
- Divorce Rate: rose 400%
- STI rate: rose >300%
- Social pathology: rose 400%
