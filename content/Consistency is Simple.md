Consistency is simple. It is not always easy, though. Consistent behavior is easy to predict. Gives known results. Makes communication and teamwork easier. 

Consistency might be the best example of something that is *simple*, but not always *easy*.
- *Example*: “I will wake up at 5:30am every day to work out”. Simple goal. Not an easy one.

[[Simplicity]] is almost universally good. Therefore consistency is too.
