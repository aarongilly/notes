**An "upgrade" to a personal possession leads to a cascade of additional desires for other upgrades.**

The Diderot Effect is what happens when the upgrade of one personal possession causes a cascade of additional desired upgrades. It was named after a French philosopher (and co-founder of EncyclopÃ©die) "Denis Diderot", who was broke, came across some money, got a nice fancy silk robe, then replaced basically everything else he owned to match the "quality" of his robe, and was broke again. 

The Diderot Effect is an example of [[Lifestyle Creep]] and leads to no real overall increase in happiness or satisfaction due to the [[Hedonic Treadmill]].

## Examples

- You buy a new phone - which needs a new case & charging stand, and suddenly your computer seems a bit out of date, and your watch starts to feel old
- You get a new couch - which makes your living room feel weird, so you get a new rug & end tables, then new chairs
