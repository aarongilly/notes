**Energy can’t be generated perfectly in line with the demand curve.**

All energy production is subject to variation in efficacy. 

Green methods, such as solar & wind energy, are *particularly* ‘bursty’ power generation methods. Booms and busts. This is why energy must be stored for use later ([[Energy Storage]]). Traditionally this storage is done via charging chemical batteries.
