**A good cadence for deeper reviews.**

The [[Weekly Review]] is an idea cadence for creating a short term action plan, but for observing trends and measuring yourself against your longer-term objectives, a Monthly Review is just about at the sweet spot. It doesn't make sense to wait until the end of the month to review tasks, but it also doesn't really make sense to pick out a new set of focuses each night, either.  

## Ideal Monthly Review Topics

- Personal [[OKRs]] & [[KPIs]] (business may warrant more frequency)
- Performing area-by-area [[Mind Sweep]] ([[Defining Area ]])
- Reviewing and evaluating hobbies and habits ([[Refining Habits]])
- Selecting new focus
- Aligning Projects to Values
- Something from a scheduled Distributed Annual Review
