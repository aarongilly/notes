**Creative Projects follow a standard pattern, more diverging ideas - followed by fewer converging ideas.**

Starting a new creative work, its best to be in a mode of broad thinking. Let new ideas come and make note of things that might be a good fit. Don't chase rabbits too far down the path or you might miss a fully cooked steak on a side path. At a certain point you then shift into a convergent mode of thinking, as the bad ideas and only okay ideas are pruned off and the truly great ideas remain.
