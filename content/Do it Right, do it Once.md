**If you cut corners in a process, you are more likely to have to put in more effort later when things stop working.**

If you cut corners in a process, you are more likely to have to put in more effort later when things stop working.

## Examples

- Pre-drill holes so your screws don’t split the wood.
- Measure and mark so you don’t make the wrong cut and have to go back and fix it.
- Document your functions in your code so you don’t forget what you’ve done or how it’s used.
