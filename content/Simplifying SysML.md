summary: Some thoughts on democratizing knowledge wrapped up in models.

[[SysML]] (and [[UAF]]) could function as killer business documentation tools, if only they were approachable to the masses. 

## Issues to Fix
- Focus modeling around **derivatives**
	- Models are a means to an end, they are not the inherently valuable asset
- Standardizing Practices
	- Models should be consistent
	- Prefer images over boxes where possible
	- Create a "complexity ceiling" rule for diagrams
- Adding Affordances
	- Labeling relationships
	- Labeling entities
	- Removing unnecessary "SysML"isms like `<<block>>`

It looks like Capella is also an intentional simplification of SysML.
