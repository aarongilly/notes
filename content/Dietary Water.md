**Water is the 4th Macro Nutrient & we get a lot from foods.**

Water is a macronutrient. We get about half of our water from food, on average. The “8 glasses a day” is a myth. Caffeinated drinks are still drinks. They don't "dehydrate you" unless they are incredibly caffeinated and contain very little water. Even energy drinks probably supply more water than they cause you to lose.
