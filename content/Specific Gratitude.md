**Gratefulness turns into happiness when it's specific. **

Making the gratitude *specific* makes it more real. It calls attention to what's specifically worth being grateful for in your specific circumstances where you're at right *now*.

Nice - “I'm grateful for family and health”

Great - “I’m grateful that I can call my mom who loves me and **not** have to tell her I'm going to the ER”
