**Life is what you spend your energy doing for the most time.**

Something that seems true to me:

$$
life = time\times energy
$$

The things I remember (which, I guess, is me using a heuristic already) are the things I spent the most energy on for the longest time.

This equation only represents 2 of the fundamental [[3 Personal Resources]].
