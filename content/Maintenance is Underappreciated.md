**The general concept of maintenance is as important as it is unsexy. We have a debt of appreciation to all the maintainers around us.**

We owe a great deal of appreciation to the simple concept of "maintenance". The simple act of caring to somethings needs is not a "for-granted" situation. It takes prolonged dedication and rededication. We all our our mothers, fathers, and anyone who's helped us for our own sake a great deal of gratitude more than we give them. Maintaining a relationship, maintaining a house, maintaining a child. None of these are particularly exciting endeavors. **They don't promise "bold and new". The promise, at best, a deepening of the existing goods that are right in front of us.** The strengthen our bond with the people, places, and things about which we take care.
