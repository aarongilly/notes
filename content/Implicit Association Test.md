**The "IAT" is a digital tool to measure the strength of your implicit associations.**

The "IAT" is a test to determine our immediate unconscious associations. It's a word association speed test. You can use it to see how easily you can test our associations. 

There's a famous example of the IAT that basically shows you how implicitly racist you are. Most people tend to have difficulty pairing words when the grouping is "black/good" and "white/bad". the same thing is true about height, especially when it comes to men. CEOs are way skewed toward being tall (the [[Warren Harding Effect]]).

Basically this goes to show that we have unconscious biases that we aren't aware of that WILL manifest.

One reason why it's good to be tall.
