**It's easier to get $10M in venture funding than it is to get $1M.**

Examples from Tim Ferris's "[[The 4-Hour Work Week]]"...

He spoke about how the masses tend to aim at goals that "feel" more realistic, thereby making those goals harder to achieve. Case examples - it's easier to make 10 million dollars than it is to make 1 million dollars. It may be easier to take home the one "10" at the bar, than any of the four "8"s (his example).
