**AI is getting easier and cheaper, and things that host AI are also. AI-if-i-cation will be the next electrification.**

AI is going to be everywhere. It will only expand as technologies make it faster, easier, and more efficient to proliferate not only the AI, but the things that are its inputs. In much the same way that everything that was once a manual machine was electrified at the start of the 1900â€™s, everything that is now dumb will be given some level of cognition. 

Deep mind pointed there AI at the game breakout and it tied itself to play with him within 1000 games perfectly. They had figured out how to break the game and win faster and more consistently than any human ever could.
