## Quadrants

**Quadrant 2)** not urgent, but important. Very free people spend enough of their time here. Thus us where PC (the ability to produce) lives.

**Quadrant 3)** urgent, but Unimportant. Try doing fewer of these tasks. Be okay with some falling off the table, because you’ll be able to do much more important work with that time. 

**Quadrant 4)** unimportant and not urgent. Don’t do these things.
