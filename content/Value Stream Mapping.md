Value Stream Mapping is a [[Diagram Types (index)|Visual Analysis Technique]] to view how [[Business Value]] is (or is not) produced throughout the lifecycle of a process that takes time, **to identify [[Waste]] and bottlenecking factors**. It's slightly more structured than I was expecting, going in. It is built using layers (whose nature seems to vary slightly from source-to-source) and oriented about a timeline, like [[Sequence Diagrams]] turned on their side with swim lanes for information, processes, and value-production (as measured in [[Metrics]]):

## Layers
### Information Flow
Signals that affect system behavior. What kicks off the system. Status messages generated.

### Material Flows
Processes that happen. The material that flows between them. Including process metadata, like "[[Takt Time]]", success rate, etc.

### Timeline
The bottom of all the Value Stream Maps I've seen are where the actual *value stream* is.
