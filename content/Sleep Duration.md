**We probably need ~7 hours, most people get somewhere around 6.5.**

Despite common preachings, studies indicate we don't probably need 8 hours a night. Instead the average person probably needs something more like 7 hours each night. But it's completely variable. Average Americans sleep roughly 6 1/2 hours each night. Turns out that's about the same, if not slightly *more* than contemporary hunter gatherers.
