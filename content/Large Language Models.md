> [!quote] ChatGPT's response to "What are Large Language Models"
> A large language model, like ChatGPT, is a type of artificial intelligence system designed to understand and generate human-like text. It's trained on vast amounts of text data and learns patterns in language to generate coherent and contextually relevant reason-sets to user inputs.  These models can range from several hundred million to billions of parameters, allowing them to understand and produce complex and nuanced text across various domains. 

Current well-known LLMs:
- OpenAI's ChatGPT
- Google's Gemini (formerly Bard)
- Meta's LLaMA
