### Go see for yourself, and thoroughly understand the situation

Solve problems by going to see their source personally. Do not rely on theory and people to tell you or screens show you. Give yourself the ability to speak with first-hand knowledge. 

### Make decisions slowly, and by consensus, then act upon them rapidly

Look through and discuss all potential options with all potential stakeholders. Select those options that make the most sense to the most people. This will enable a broader net of solutions to be cast, and have the most people on board to implement them.

### Become a learning organization through relentless reflection and continuous improvement

Once processes are stabilized, use continuous improvement tools to find the root cause of inefficiencies, and apply effective countermeasures. Design the process to use as little inventory as possible. Reflect on processes and projects at key milestones. Apply learnings to the standards. Do not reinvent the wheel!
