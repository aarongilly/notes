**What am I trying to get done right now**

So many productivity and happiness tips and techniques have to do with knowing what you're trying to do **right now**. Yet this is a thing that I continually struggle with. Constant distraction, most often in the form of so-called "[[Productive Distraction]]". 

[[Monotasking]] requires you to know what your one task is, [[What's Important Now]].

> [[Anxiety]] is thought without control.¬†

## Helping Know Your Immediate Task
- Write it down. Like the "next" portion of [[Captain‚Äôs Log|interstitial journaling]], or simply writing what you want to have done before switching tasks
- [[Treat Work Sessions like the Cinema]]
	- [[Tailor Your Environment]] to remove distractions
- Follow the plan. If you have a plan for this time. Use it. 
- On a computer? [[Organize Focuses by Desktop]]
	- Make a clean space for your current purpose.
- Where is your [[Mindfulness & Now|mind]]? Try to notice when you're off-task and "gently" bring yourself back to the task at hand. 
	- You can use a ~10 minute subtle timer to check in on yourself every 10 minutes
