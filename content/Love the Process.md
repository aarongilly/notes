**Don't wait for results to give yourself permission to be satisfied.**

Once you've achieved your goals you'll still be the same person. Love the work. Love the process. 

Goals set up a pattern of differed happiness, meanwhile a focus on a system can lead to continual happiness. You aren't thinking "I'll lose 10 pounds, *then* I'll be happy", but instead you can be happy knowing you didn't eat out **today**.

> [!tldr] ⚠️ Don’t defer happiness.

Or, as it's presented in [[The Happiness Equation]] : "Be Happy First". Don't put it at the end of a sequence that goes "work real hard → achieve greatness → have all the things → be happy". 

James Stuber suggests the existence of [[Type 2 Fun]] to describe feeling happy while doing the work that *leads to the thing you want*.

Once you achieve your goals, you'll probably have new goals. You have to spend much of your days [[Living For Now]].
