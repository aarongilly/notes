The game "Stardew Valley" was created whole cloth entirely by one dude over the course of 5 years. He worked as a theater usher immediately after getting his CS degree so he wouldn't get comfortable. He had to teach himself mastery over things like: music, pixel art, game design, and obviously programming. 

He had the confidence, dedication, and determination to make it happen himself.
