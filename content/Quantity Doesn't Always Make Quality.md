summary: More doesn't always mean better, if it's not more of the right thing.

While it's true that (sometimes) [[Quantity Makes Quality]], it has to be *the right kind* of quantity. In the photography class example in that note - the students who took the most pictures took the *highest quality* pictures because what they were doing *just so happened* to line up with a quantity ➡️ quality setup. Photography is a "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take" activity. Taking many pictures is akin to running many [[Low-Cost Trials]]. The key is that the students didn't just take 1,000s of photos of the same thing, they took 1,000s of photos across the whole semester, in a wide range of scenarios. I assume many of them wound up *accidentally* learning that a scenario they wouldn't have predicted to make a good photo actually was good. This is a lesson they wouldn't have learned by *not* going for quantity. 

The answer here **isn't** "[[Less, but Better]]" either. The key is that the *quantity* they were maximizing wasn't simply "photo count" - it was photo count under different conditions. It's more like [[Deliberate Practice]]. It's selectively identifying the aspects of the process that actually deliver value, then [[Drilling Cycles]] those.

## Notes

Linear, long-form notetaking is probably less effective as a learning tool than something like [[Visual Notetaking]]. If you go to a lecture and perfectly transcribe everything the professor says, you've been diligently taking notes. You've captured *everything*. However you've probably learned *nothing* and produced something much less valuable than if you'd [[Distillation|Distilled]] the content into something more pithy, or transformed it into something else.
