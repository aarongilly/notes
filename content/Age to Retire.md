**59 1/2 for Retirement Accounts. Between 62 and 67 for social security.**

Currently America’s stance on ‘full retirement age’ is **67**. But social security benefits start as early as age **62**. The benefits of social security start at 62, but increase the longer you wait until you hit 67, at which point they max out. All of this subject to change with law changes.

In order to be eligible to receive social security you need to achieve a certain number of “credits”, which are earned by working during your lifetime. Specifically how much you need to work and how much you need to earn is governed by laws. Generally the bar is low. 

There’s nothing saying you couldn’t retire earlier, which is what all the [[FIRE]] guys are all about. You simply have to float yourself. See “[[Money to Retire]]”.
