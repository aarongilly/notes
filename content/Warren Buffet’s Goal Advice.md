**Pick no more than 5 goals. Ignore the rest.**

Warren Buffetâ€™s advice on how to beat accomplish your big, truly big goals.

1. Get a piece of paper and write down your top 20-25 goals and ambitions. 
2. Prioritize the completed list. Select no more than the 4 or 5 Goals you want to achieve most.
3. Actively avoid the other 20 goals. Chasing them will spread your efforts too thin and you will fail to achieve your [[Priorities]].

This is the key component. Do fewer things with greater [[focus]] and you will achieve more. [[Less, but Better]].
