**Pick no more than 5 goals. Ignore the rest.**

Warren Buffetâ€™s advice on how to beat accomplish your big, truly big goals.

1. Get a piece of paper and write down your top 20-25 goals and ambitions. 
2. Prioritize the completed list. Select no more than the 4 or 5 Goals you want to achieve most.
3. Actively avoid the other 20 goals. Chasing them will spread your efforts too thin and you will fail to achieve anything.

This is the key component. Do fewer things with greater [[focus]] and you will achieve more. [[Less, but Better]].
