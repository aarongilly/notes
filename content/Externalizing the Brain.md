**Multiple ways of extending the mind to the physical world.**

One of the core themes of Daniel Levitin's "[[The Organized Mind]]" was to extoll the benefits of extending the mind through externalizing it to the physical world. This was presented in several ways:

- Taking notes, including the [[Index Card System]] - which is very [[Slip-Box Method]]-like
- Use of [[Calendars are the Most Important Productivity Tool|calendars]]
- Making heavy use of lists and categories
- Utilizing [[Contextual Reminders]]
- Building in [[Affordances]] to tools to make their usage obvious, or pre-loading a bag with objects you'll need well in advance of a trip, or by putting your car keys on the item you need to return to the store.
