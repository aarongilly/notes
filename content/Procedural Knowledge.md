**They're like Riding a bike**

Humans don't have a great grasp over exactly how our brains remember things,  it for some reason procedural knowledge, the stuff that's so engrained you don't even have to think about it when you're doing it, that stuff is *sticky*. It's riding a bike. That's a procedure. 

It's why you couldn't reproduce the layout of a keyboard u less you imagined yourself typing the alphabet at a keyboard. You dont *know* where every key is....  if you **do** know where every key *feels*.
