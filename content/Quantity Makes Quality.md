**Doing something a lot is the best way to do it well.**

Doing something often, perhaps even without thought, is better than thinking about doing the thing and theorizing how it might be best. 

> [!tldr] üëåüèª Quantity begets quality

But it has to be the right *kind* of quantity - this may not always be obvious.

## Photo Class Example

A professor broke his class in half. One half was graded only on the QUANTITY of their photos. The other half only on the quality. At the end of the semester, all of the photos of the highest quality came from the quantity side of the room.

They were doing the work and learning. The other half was just theorizing.
