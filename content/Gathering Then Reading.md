**Read articles in phases: Gather online. Read in Pocket.**

A technique to increase your chance at engaging with good articles - don't pit reading long-form articles against social media and pictures of cats. Read in two phases.

1. Do a general browsing of things things that might be interesting. When something is interesting, save it to [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com).
2. Make undistracted time with Pocket to properly read the articles you've deemed worth of saving for later.

WIth Pocket you can also tag and highlight sections from the articles. This phase-based approach allows you to keep at front of mind [[What's Important Now]].
