**Those who have the greatest negative impacts on the environment have the least incentive to stop.**

Our growth has come at the expense of the environment. The faithful have suggested that we have the ingenuity necessary to build and solve the ecological problems we are creating as they are being created. However, this does not recognize the fact that those resolutions may (and indeed, are) only being seen by those populations who may afford them. The ecological damages affect everyone on the globe, yet those who are causing them the most are the most shielded from them.

We are not inclined to stop and be satisfied with anything. We need to push the creation of new economic opportunities in the prevention of Ecological disaster. If we don’t create economic incentives to prevent disaster, and we don’t remove the current incentives contributing to it - people will continue to do what they do. The law of least effort will lead to global meltdowns, affecting everyone; but disproportionately destroying the lives of those of lesser means.
