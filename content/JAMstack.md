**[[JavaScript]], APIs, and Markup**

JAMstack is an architecture for making dynamic web applications using static pages and API calls out to services, which are managed and handled via JavaScript. This is as opposed to a “make a copy of my computer in the cloud” approach to development.

JAMstacks are easier to scale and easier to secure, at the cost of being slightly more complicated to set up to begin with. 

The use of JAMstack technology may result in **over-reliance on third-party services.** You don't own your own fate. If a cloud service is down or changes it's API you and your work may be screwed.
