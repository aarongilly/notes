**It's often better to do nothing & keep options open rather than to do something wrong.**

Knowing when to pass up poor opportunities is hugely important. Saying yes to everything means you have no control over the direction of your life. It's only through saying no to some opportunities that you can be free and available to fully commit to and take advantage of better ones. The point of this is not to avoid living, but instead to intentionally choose the life you want. 

## Example

Professional baseball players that made a name for themselves hitting home runs against lesser pitchers going up have to learn to look for the pitches they want, or they'll strikeout swinging at everything. Pick your pitches.
