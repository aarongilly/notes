People who talk with their hands are better at getting their points across to others. Gesturing engages non-verbal parts of the brain in the listening process. It's been studied and demonstrated that **learners are better able to recall points made alongside accompanying gestures** upon the conclusion of a lecture. Learning languages by associating new words with gestures leads to quicker language acquisition.

This has been incorporated into the training of various professors for subjects ranging from language to geology.
