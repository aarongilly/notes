**Fear of a thing that *may* happen.**

There is a common pattern of occurrences:
1. You anticipate a bad thing or symptom may happen
2. Your anticipation creates fear and [[Anxiety]]
3. The [[anxiety]] causes the bad thing to happen
4. Your fears are reinforced

This [[Snowball Effects]] shows up in all sorts of places.
- Fear of failing a test causes your study to be unfocused which causes you to perform poorly. 
- Fear of missing a shot causes your brain to forget how to make your arms move right and you miss.
- Fear of misspeaking in front of someone causes you to misspeak. 

Three techniques I've come across to break this chain:
- **lean in to failing** - use [[Paradoxical Intentions]] and try to anticipate how *bad* the thing could go. This alleviates pressure and can cause it to go better.
- **reframe** fear as excitement. The body signals for both are essentially the same, and you can often trick yourself into being excited to (give a big presentation/make the phone call/whatever)
- **go first** - minimize the amount of time spent agonizing. Jump directly into the pool without dipping in a toe. Volunteer to be the first one on the group presentation. Get it over with.  => [[Action Relieves Anxiety]]
