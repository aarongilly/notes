**Allocate each day a genre of task or activity, then bias work on that day towards the genre.**

### Day Theming

The simple way to do [[Time Blocking]] is to do so by **day**. *Monday I’m focusing on this, Tuesday on that...* and so on. This can work, but may fail do to lack of definition. Most people can’t afford to literally spend an entire day accomplishing only one variety of thing. Inevitably you’ll spend much of one day working on something outside of the theme. It sounds like a good “beginners” approach to the idea of Time Blocking.
