**Many modern illnesses are related to chronic low-level inflammation in which the whole body is always "just a bit" inflamed.**

Many of the illnesses and issues we face in modern society are symptoms of a body which faces low levels of general [[Inflammation]] constantly. These levels tamp down when we do even moderate amounts of activity, and thus people who avoid prolonged periods of [[Chronic Inactivity]] are found to be less likely to die than those who remain inactive more often and for longer.

Chronic Low-level Inflammation Conditions
