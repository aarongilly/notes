**Tumor Necrosis Factor - a cytokine, alerter of the immune system.**

Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a signaling protein (a cytokine) in the immune system responsible for mounting an inflammatory response. It’s interacts with two receptors:

1. TNFR1 - pro-inflammation, promotes cell death
2. TNFR2 - anti-inflammation, promotes wound healing

**Suppression of TNFR1** is important in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, like [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]. That’s what the [[Biologics]] are doing. That’s why those drugs also lower your body’s ability to fight off other infections, because they dampen the pro-inflammation TNFR1 receptor activation.
