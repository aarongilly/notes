**Compound Olympic Weightlifting technique to lift a bar overhead.**

The Jerk (sometimes called "Split Jerk") is an explosive, Compound [[Olympic Weightlifting]] technique in which a loaded barbell is lifted from the shoulders to a position above the head. This is accomplished by both pushing the bar up (using the entire body, including the legs) while simultaneously lowering the body under the bar to "catch" it at a position with arms extended overhead. 

It is the second half of the [[Clean and Jerk]] technique. 

It's related to, but different from the [[Power Lifting]] technique [[Overhead Press]]. See [[Jerk vs Press]] for that.
