**Influence your environment, because it influences you.**

Where you can, change your environment to better suit the person you want to be. Your context is a huge influencer of your behavior - one of the largest influences there is. 

It is easy to become blind to parts of your environment that are bad habit cues and unnecessary friction between you and good behaviors when you see them every day. Every once in a while, try to stop and notice how your environment sets you up to become the person you wish to be.

Avoid mixing contexts between habits. If, you have two competing habits that are triggered by the same context, you'll more often default to the *easier* habit, letting the other one fall aside.
