**The Slip-Box Method category of on-going capture.**

This is the [[Slip-Box Method]] category of ongoing capture. As new thoughts come up that are interesting, or as you hear quotes worth remembering, or as you read, capture new [[Atomic Notes]]. Write them in your own words and cite your sources. Capture them into an [[Inbox]] for your notetaking system, or in the margins of whatever you're reading and transfer them later. Make a habit to add new knowledge to the collection you've amassed. Get it into the inbox, and you can decide later how it's connected to everything else and if it's worth keeping.
