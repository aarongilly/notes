**Some judgments are verifiable, some arenâ€™t.**

Some judgments are verifiable like a prediction of how much rain will fall. Other judgments are not verifiable like how well did your employee do last year. It is obvious when a verifiable judgment is in accurate. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ It may seem impossible to improve a non-verifiable judgment. But we can make improvements by focusing on the **judgment process.**

## Examples

### Verifiable

- How much rain will fall tomorrow?
- What will the GDP of Mexico be next year?

### Non-verifiable

- Which solution to a problem should we use?
- What punishment should be selected for a crime?
