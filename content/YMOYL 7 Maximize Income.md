**Understand your relationship with work & use it to your advantage.**

Also file this under the "does this really count as a tip" tip. 

This step, like most personal development steps, would have you stop and **ask yourself questions to really understand your relationship** with your work. 

One of the big key points from [[Your Money or Your Life]] is that **work should be separated from the thing you do for money**. Work can be the thing you do that you do because it's your calling. 

And when it comes to the thing you do for money, we should aim to make as much per hour as humanly possible, in accordance with our desires and values. [[Per Capita is more Important than Gross]]
