**Communication and simulation**

Modeling really only serves two basic purposes: **communication** and **simulation**. Don’t confuse one for the other.

A big criticism of [[UML]] is that it’s overly-complicated. There are constructs for edge cases of edge cases, you can not glean the immediate message. The same has been, in my experience, true of most [[SysML]] models as well.

If the purpose of the model is for **simulation**, then completeness is necessary. This would be as a proxy for better testing methods. When it comes to *software development*, there are actual testing methods that can be (and should be) used. This means UML diagrams should probably be built for **************************communication**************************. This means jettisoning the details. Focus on what’s important from a [[Pareto Analysis]] perspective. 

It seems to me that BPMN serves no purpose, aside from potentially being used as a visual configuration in a workflow management software.

[[IDEF0]] is fantastic because it knows what it was for.
