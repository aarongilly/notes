**It's better to realize when you're wrong than to lie to yourself and everyone else that you're not.**

Everyone is wrong from time to time, yet we never *think* we are wrong in the moment. These two facts cannot logically coexist. You, like everyone, are wrong from time to time.

There's nothing wrong being *wrong*. There **is** something wrong with not being willing to admit to yourself that you might be wrong, not being willing to change your beliefs in light of new evidence, or trying to convince others you're right out of fear. 

You can be confident and admit ignorance. You can be both wrong and smart at the same time.
