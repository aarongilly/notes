**A powerful tool to free the mind & surface information where & when it is useful.**

Contextual reminders is one of **the most helpful tools** you can add to your personal arsonal of achievement.

[[Periodic Reviews]] are just an excuse to have a framework of recurring contexts, and a time to deal with those tasks surfaced by the reminders/calendar events.

## Context Classes

        - *The surface of your workbench*
        - *Next to your car keys*
        - *Literally the middle of your floor*
    - Logical
        - *Common directories in your computer*
        - *Same page in Notion*
- Time
    - Absolute
        - *At 5pm*
        - *On March 2nd*
        - *At 9AM on April 9th, 2021*
    - Relative
        - *Tomorrow*
        - *Next week*
        - *Three fridays from now*
- Relationship
    - Interpersonal
        - *With my spouse*
        - *With my boss*
        - *With Jimbo Jones*
    - Logistical
        - *Stack ripped clothes on the sowing machine*

`Notion` is capable of both variants of time-based reminders. "@remind next tuesday" and "@remind 3/4/2021" both work to create Notion, mobile, & emails notifications.
