As a form of avoiding the [[Sunk Cost Bias]], you can undertake an experiment in which you temporarily stop doing something that’s currently taking up some of your [[3 Personal Resources]]. 

1. Identify something you’re spending time/money/energy on that you’re not 100% sure is necessary 
2. For a few days (or weeks), simply **stop doing the thing**
3. See what happens.

You’re almost assuredly routinely doing something for someone else that they *don’t actually care about*. It’s not a good use of [[Life Energy]] to put resources in for no essential benefit, and it spreads you thinner. It’s better to do [[Less, but Better]].
