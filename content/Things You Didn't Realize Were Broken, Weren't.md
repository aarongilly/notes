summary: If you didn't realize something was broken until seeing "the better way", there's a good chance it wasn't broken to begin with.

**`= this.summary`**

In Silicon Valley the formula is to find a gap, some part of everybody's lives where they encounter some form of friction, then create something that removes that tiny bit of friction from their lives. This will show them what they thought was normal was actually a broken process, and that your product is the solution.

The issue is, though, that things you don't **realize** are broken, are effectively *not* broken... and often times the "fix" isn't really a fix, so much as an added bit of complexity to manage ("sign up for our service and we'll < do whatever > ")... or simply makes you hate some part of the process you didn't used to hate. 

It's good to grind and brew your own coffee. K-Cups suck.
