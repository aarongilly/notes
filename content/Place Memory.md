**Place memory is managed by the hippocampus.**

The hippocampus is our brain’s place memory structure. It is the structure that was found to be enlarged in London taxi drivers. It reads a little physical cues in the external world to remember where things are. It doesn’t work quite as well in the digital world.

Place memory works great for things that don't move. It's not great at keeping track of things that do move. This is why organization is so helpful. Why you lose things that don't have "a place they go".
