**Nothing is truly stagnant. Everything degrades.**

Nothing is truly stagnant, not permanent. Everything degrades. Everything needs maintenance on a long enough timeline. The very best we can do is make things that will last for our lifetimes. Even our most basic software is dependent on kernels technologies that may go extinct, on computers that will fail. **The only way to ensure things endure is to maintain them**. Upgrade your software and hardware, and change with the times.
