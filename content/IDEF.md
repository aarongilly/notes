**Brief look at IDEF0-5**

# What is IDEF?

## History & Context

Back in the 70s the United States Air Force hired a bunch of PhDs to come up with a recommended set of best practices when creating and organizing system models. This was meant to enable greater agility in collaborating on complex projects between agencies within the Department of Defense.    

### Legacy
Unfortunately, despite my adoration of IDEF as a family, the ONLY language that's seems to have caught even a modest amount of adoption/success is [[IDEF0]].

## Why It's Great

Models are used to represent physical objects, concepts, processes, and entire domains. Each modeling language works as a standalone system, but they also build naturally upon one-another. They are a wonderful mix of structure & flexibility. A perfect balance between high-level and high-detail. Perhaps most importantly, they are a mix of intuitive and complete. It takes no training to understand an IDEF0 Function Diagram. [[IDEF3]] Schematics can be interpreted with a cursory glance at a legend of symbols. However, despite this at-a-glance utility, they can be incredibly deep and encapsulate and present knowledge that would take years to cultivate otherwise.

### Recurring Themes

- Graphics over words
- Definition specificity
- Unique indices & cross-referencing
- Layers of complexity represented through decomposition
- Consistent application techniques

# IDEF0-5

Pretty well spelled out below.

Note: I just realized the IDEF3 split-out is wrong. It should be an "&" and it should also include the IDEF3 version of [[State Diagrams]].
