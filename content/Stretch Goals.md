**Big, ambitious goals you set before you know how you'll achieve them (or even if they are possible) to force you to think in terms of revolution and not just evolution.**

Stretch Goals are those you set out at the beginning of an endeavor that seem like they're almost impossible to achieve, but would result in a "resounding success" if they were met. Setting stretch goals is a good way to avoid keeping your ambitions too low in an effort to ensure you don't fall short of your [[SMART Goals]].

These are tied closely in with what John Doerr called "Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals" in [[Measure What Matters]] time and time again.  The point of OKRs was that you weren't *really* supposed to achieve **all** of them, because that meant you set your ambitions too low.
