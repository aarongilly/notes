**Mental shortcuts for solving problems quickly.**

Heuristics are mental shortcuts that allows people to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently. These rule-of-thumb strategies shorten decision-making time and allow people to function without constantly stopping to think about their next course of action.

Heuristics are not a good thing, nor a bad thing. They have good and bad qualities. They are a significant contributor to [[Noise]] and [[Bias Index]].

The [[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]] defines heuristics as:
> Principles learnt from practical experience that yet lack a scientific understanding as to the explanation of "why".
> ([[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]] pg 92)
