**Track Every Penny that Comes Into or Goes Out of Your life**

The most often repeated phrase in [[Your Money or Your Life]] is "Track every penny that comes into or goes out of your life". The authors didn't have a suggested method. But they stressed whatever method you so choose needs to work for **you**. 

There are no "best set of budget categories", there are what works for you and what doesn't work for you. For categories, see [[YMOYL 3 Monthly Tabulation]]
