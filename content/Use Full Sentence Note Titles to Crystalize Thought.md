This is a good practice. It turns what could be a lesser-version of [[Wikipedia]], where links are just "related" into a semantic *why* they are related via *how* they are used. 
The link up there to Wikipedia suggests "there's a note having to do with Wikipedia", meanwhile a note that is able to [[Use Full Sentence Note Titles to Crystalize Thought]] becomes **immediately** clear with what that notes relationship is to this one. This still allows you to grow, develop, and build on **ideas**, but doesn't relegate them to simple *topics*. This quite literally grows the intersection between crossing trains of thought. 

> [!tip] Notes that contain **ideas** are best fully expressed, notes that only talk about a topic are best left terse.

Side benefit: this is the ultimate form of [[Distillation]]. You don't have to express the idea perfectly right out the gate, they can be added to/refined as a part of [[Progressive Summarization]].
