**We only "render" the small sliver of the world we have the capacity/capability/experience to notice.**

There is an infinitely detailed world around each and every one of us, yet we only perceive some small subset of the available details. The author utilized a "Blender" (3d software) metaphor, describing that "*Renders*" of a scene will invariably represent only a small portion of the model, and the appearance of that portion will be dependent on the parameters of the render. In very much the same way our realities are rendered by our conscious mind. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ We are the rendering engine and we only notice what we notice.

When you buy a car, suddenly you see other instances of the same make and model as your car everywhere. They were there all along, but you weren't primed to see them, therefore you didn't. It's like they didn't exist. The same concept applies to things like inequality. Outright racist or sexist remarks may be noticed by all, but subtler expressions of racist or sexist behaviors may not be noticed those not in the minority class.
