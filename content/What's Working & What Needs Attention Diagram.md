**`= this.summary`**

In the service of deriving [[Goals (index)|goals]] for 2024 and formalizing (or codifying) my [[Personal MOS]], I did a thing that was interesting. For the sake of me potentially publishing these notes, this is a generalized representation & fictitious example:

![[What's Working, What's Not 2023-12-13 15.32.24.excalidraw|90%]]
## Process
1. Put all life [[Defining Area|area]]s in boxes in rough proximity to each other on a whiteboarding application like [[Excalidraw]]
2. Place labels around each area for:
	1. things you're doing
 
Basically, anything in green is something you should celebrate & keep around. Anything in red needs some form of attention. It could be that your goal should change, or the tool should go away.
