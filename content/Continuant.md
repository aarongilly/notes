**A thing that retains its identity even though it's states and relations may change**

“Continuant” is defined as a thing that exists that retains its identity even if its states and relations may change.

`Shoe` is still shoe even if it's “your shoe” or “my shoe”, or if it's “dirty shoe” or “clean shoe”.
