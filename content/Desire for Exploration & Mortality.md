**The less time you think you have left, the more you focus on enjoying things you already know you enjoy.**

There's a direct correlation between the perceived number of years of free living ahead of you and the desire for "new" experiences. Those with **perceived** shortened numbers of days left alive tend to want to spend them with people they already know, doing things they already know they like. It's only those who think they have a long healthy future ahead of them that are willing to defer those things that might make them happiest right now under the guise of a brighter future.
