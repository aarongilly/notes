**A list of things you're not sure you want to say no to, but not sure you want to say yes to.**

You need a place to incubate ideas you're not sure about, projects you're not sure you want to take on, and to get those inevitable continuing [[Open Loops]] out of your head. This allows you to achieve [[Inbox Zero]] without having to decide on literally everything all at once. 

The Someday, Maybe list should be reviewed like any other list, but perhaps less frequently. They are good candidates for a monthly review.
