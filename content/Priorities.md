**The term “Priority” didn’t used to be plural.**

The etymology of the term “Priority” used to mean one thing. It was the prior thing that was being worked on (from a previous working session). It wasn’t until the past ~100 years(?) that businessmen introduced the term “priorities” and sullied the real meaning of "to [[Put First Things First]]."
