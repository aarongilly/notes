**The types of people who cause widespread change**

A few kinds of highly influential people are what connect us ("Connectors"), bring us new information ("Mavens"), and imprint onto us their attitudes ("Salesmen"). These are the 20% of the people who do 80% of the work in creating Epidemics of Word of Mouth.

## Connectors

Connectors know people - lots of people - and know them well enough to know how to best spread a message. They know who knows who and cast a very wide social net. They are the reason the [[6 Degrees of Separation]] is such a small number.

## Mavens

Mavens are people who watch a given domain very carefully, and know how to spread the word about facets of it when the time comes. They know exact prices. They are clued into to technological change. They know the best restaurants.

## Salesmen

Some people are just more impactful at imprinting their desires onto those people around them. They do a better job of livening up a room when they're happy. The also do a better job of brining down the fun when they aren't. They are good salesmen.
