**6 Principles for Mapping Information**

![[assets/Untitled 19.png]]

These 6 principles are best practices for research-based information mapping:

1. Chunking - break information down to small, digestible amounts ([[~7 - The Limit of Simultaneous Info]])
2. Relevance - limit each unit of info to a single topic
3. Labeling - label each unit clearly to identify its content
4. Consistency - be consistent with terminology, organization, formatting, and sequencing
5. Accessible Detail - organize information in such a way that detail can be drilled into if desired, but that drilling isn't required
6. Integrated graphics - use graphics as well as text to clarify and emphasize things. Like the above.
