**Slow burns are easier, more sustainable, and can produce better results.**

Heavy Lifts and Slow Burns are two ways to approach large Projects/goals. 

Heavy Lifts are done essentially all at once. You knock the thing out, through great effort. They are fast, but strenuous.

Slow Burns are done incrementally over time. Slow burns are sustainable in the long run. They don't wear you out, at the expense of producing results more slowly. Slow burns utilize the [[Sweet Spot ðŸŽ¯]].

## Examples
### Heavy Lifts
- Take a day of vacation to demo the bathroom

###  Slow Burns
- Spend 10 minutes every few nights tearing out bits of the bathroom piece by piece
- [[Stitch Existing Materials into Something New]]
