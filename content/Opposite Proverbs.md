**Many famous “wise quotes” have opposing quotes.**

Just because you hear a good saying doesn’t mean it’s true. Advice is situational. There are tons of examples of opposite “wise” sayings.

### Examples

> To thine own self, be true.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
> 

> It’s never too late to learn.
You can’t teach and old dog new tricks.
> 

> If at first you don’t succeed, try try again.
There’s no point beating a dead horse.
> 

> Perfect is the enemy of Good Enough.
Good is the enemy of Great.
> 

> Actions speak louder than words.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
> 

> Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Better safe than sorry.
>
