**You can start with can do, want to do, or do, in any order.**

We think there is a linear path:

Can Do It → Want to Do It → Do It

But in reality, **it's a cycle.** You can start anywhere in the chain. The  author of [[The Happiness Equation]] told the story of how he didn't learn to swim until he was an adult. He couldn't do it. So he didn't want to do it. So he didn't. Then he signed up for classes where you basically just swam. Eventually he learned he could do it, then he learned he wanted to.
