**A short routine meant to allow you to mentally move on.**

Distracting non-rabbit holes? Try some of the following - for ~1 to 2 minutes:

- [[Focus]] all your attention on feeling what one small part of your body is experiencing.
- Try to count how many distinct sounds you can hear.
- Spend a moment observing things you can see around you.
- Touch something in your environment. How cool is it? What is its texture?
- Can you smell anything? Can you still taste the last thing you ate/drank?
- Get moving: go for a walk. Do some pushups.
