**`= this.summary`**

There is no set of productivity techniques and time-saving "life-hacks" that will make you feel truly "on top" of life. You will never have [[Enough]] productivity. There will always be more you will *want* to do. More you have could jam into your schedule. More things other people want you to do. The only way you could **possibly** feel sort of "on top" of stuff is to be so shut off from other people that you'll succumb to loneliness and depression. You have to learn to [[Love the Process]]. 

The day is not long enough to do everything you might *want* to do. You should not end each day disappointed that you didn't get to your 501st task. Do a few things. Then relax. Celebrate your wins. [[The Perfect Day]] is not spent constantly producing.

> [!tldr] You're not "one simple trick" away from total life mastery. You must accept this.
