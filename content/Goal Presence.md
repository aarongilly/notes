**How aware of your goals you are on an hour-by-hour basis**

Goal presence is the term the guy who branded himself the 'Ultraworking' founder came up with to describe *how aware of your goals you are on an hour-by-hour basis*.

Do you write down your goals for the week on Monday morning, and forget about them by lunchtime? How much are you thinking about them by Tuesday?

If you're not aware of your goals, how are you supposed to achieve them?

This is probably one of the benefits of [[Time Blocking]], [[Periodic Reviews]], and the [[3 Goals a Day]] idea.
