**Business Process Modeling Notation - a specific modeling implementation under the "UML" umbrella.**

Business Process Modeling Notation is a standard for graphically representing behaviors in a business. It is part of the [[UML]] standard. It is very descriptive and can be used to model very complicated processes. Part of this power comes at the cost of simplicity, as there are **116 unique elements to the most-current standard** (2.0), which makes BPMN somewhat difficult to interpret, thereby undermining a primary value proposition for the technique.

BPMN is functionally similar to IDEF0 and [[IDEF3]] from the IDEF family ([[IDEF]]).
