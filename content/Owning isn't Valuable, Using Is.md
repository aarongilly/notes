**Owning something isn't valuable. Using something is.**

Owning something isn’t what brings you value, really it’s just using the thing. Thus sharing is an incredibly powerful concept. You don’t need to own something if you can borrow it easily. Your stuff also serves to benefit the most but sharing it.

Ask a neighbor or friend or family. Borrow things from the library. Rent things rather than purchase them. 

Personal cars spend about 95% of their lives NOT being driven. Perhaps more.
