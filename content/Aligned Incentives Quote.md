**(When it comes to Behavior) What matters more than “wanting something” is aligned incentives. - 3Blue1Brown**

3Blue1Brown describing his decision to stop including sponsors and ads in his videos, because they incentivize making videos for a wider audience (even if that audience doesn't particularly find much value in the content), and him wanting to only make content for those Rate sports of people who really what he wants to make. He describes “wanting” to not be pushed to make low quality high reach videos, but in order to really follow through on that want, he aligned his incentives with it.
