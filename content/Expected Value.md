**Likelihood of each result times it’s result.**

When making decisions, take into account Expected Value. 

Expected Value is the sum when you add (each possible outcome’s result x it’s likelihood).

## Examples

- Flip a coin, I give you $10 if it’s heads, I give you nothing if it’s tails. Expected Value: $2.50.
- Flip a coin, I give you $10 if it’s heads, you give me $10 if it’s tails. Expected Value: $0
- Roll a die, if it’s a 6 I give you $60. If it’s anything else you give me $10. Expected Value: (1/6)*$60+(5/6)*(-$10) = $1.67
