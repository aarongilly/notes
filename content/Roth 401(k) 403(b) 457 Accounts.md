**Roth variants of the employer-sponsored retirement accounts**

Essentially every variety of Pre-Tax Account has an After-Tax (”Roth”) variant. Most of the same limits and rules apply. You just pay taxes now, and not later.

Roth 401(k)/403(b)/457 account limits are independent of either type of IRA account.
