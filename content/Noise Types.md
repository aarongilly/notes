**Level Noise vs Pattern Noise**

![[assets7E7EEC26-F039-451A-ACD1-7356283B1915.jpeg]]

**Level noise** - different base levels between individualsâ€™ averages across all cases

**Pattern noise** - differences **within** an individual **between** cases

Level noise only takes into account the differences between judges holistically. Pattern noise takes into account the differences between judges 

System noise is a combination of pattern noise and level noise. Pattern noise is typically larger.
