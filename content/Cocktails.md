**Quality over Quantity**

Cocktails are made of a base liquor, some form of modifier (juices, liqueurs), and often accents (squeeze of citrus, herbs, garnishes), and often diluted (with ice, club soda, or tonic).

There is an organization called the **IBA** (International Bartenders Association) that has a set of official drink standards.

Cocktails are "lowball" drinks. This is as opposed to "Highball" drinks. These *actually* refer to the glasses the drinks come in, but often this holds true:
- Highball = more mixer than liquor
- Lowball = more liquor than mixer

## Most Common Varieties 
- Margarita
- Cosmopolitan 
- Daiquiri
- Manhattan
- Negroni
- Old Fashioned
- Martini
- Long Island Iced Tea
- Mint Julep
- Mai Tai
- Mojito

## Glasses
Drinks are commonly served in particular glasses for whatever reason. 

Tall & Skinny ==> Short & Fat
