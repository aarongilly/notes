**Syncing with others, such as in choir, has huge effects on happiness.**

Group timing is vital to a team's success. Group codes, garb, and touching among members make groups work better together. 

Choral singing is almost as good as exercise in terms of health outcomes. Physiological and psychological benefits are found among people who sing together in a group. Syncing with people in a group has almost drug-like effects on mood and happiness. Doesn't need to be choir, could be group yoga, dance, running, etc.
