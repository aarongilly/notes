**Email is a modern worker's time sink & a trap. Most email isn't important.**

Email sucks. Modern office & knowledge workers spend nearly half their day managing emails. 90% or more of emails that come through have no real importance to you or your job. You could safely ignore nearly all of them.

Check your email one or two times a day. If you have someone whom you *always* need to be available for, make a special rule in your email client to signal you they've messaged. But even then recognize that emergencies don't take place over email. Your work is in front of you. Not in Outlook.
