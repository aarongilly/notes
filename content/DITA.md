**Darwin Information Typing Architecture - an open standard of information types**

DITA is an [[XML]]-based specification for types of documents in a topic-oriented repository of information... say like this whole Notes database.

It uses:

- Inheritance (hence “Darwin”) through specialization
- [[Transclusion]] 
- A common HTML-like structure
- 5 Topics (types of pages)
    1. Task - a series of steps to achieve an outcome
    2. Concept - objective definitions, rules, and guidelines
    3. Reference - containing specific, fact-based information
    4. Glossary Entry - defining a single sense of a given term
    5. Troubleshooting - a condition that may require a remedy, including what may have caused it and possible remedies
- Maps - that turn a DITA collection into a publishable thing
- Metadata - like the properties in this Notion database, metadata can be associated with topics, and inherited between related topics
