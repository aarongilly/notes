**A technique in jumping into minimalism with both feet.**

"Packing Party" is a term I first heard about from "The Minimalists" (two dudes whose life mission is touting minimalism, with a blog, several books, a podcast, and multiple documentaries). It's a rather extreme exercise to remove cruft and unnecessary things from your life.

## How to have a Packing Party

1. Pack up everything in you own into boxes like you were going to move.
2. Continue living. As you need things, go unpack them from the boxes.
3. After ~3 months, anything not unpacked can be given away or sold.

A less radical minimalist technique is [[One In, One Out]].
