**Managing your personal resources.**

Personal Economics is a term I use to refer to the management of your personal resources. These resources are usually considered the fundamental [[3 Personal Resources]], but could be subdivided. Energy could be split into to physical and mental energy. Time could be subdivided into the hours you've dedicated for work and the hours you've dedicated for play.
