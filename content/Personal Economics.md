**Managing your personal resources.**

Personal Economics is a term I use to refer to the management of your personal resources. These resources are usually considered the fundamental [[3 Personal Resources]], but could be subdivided. Energy could be split into to physical and mental energy. Time could be subdivided into the hours you've dedicated for work and the hours you've dedicated for play. 

You can make trades between the resources. Exchange money for time by paying someone to cook/shop/fix something for you. Exchange time for money by going to work. Exchange energy for money by doing vigorous work. It's hard to turn energy into time, I suppose.
