## Procrastination Avoidance Hierarchy
The ability to [[Focus]] is something that adds a **lot** of value to a life, and is something that can be improved. There are a multitude of [[focus]]-improvement techniques out there, and they range from "just getting started" to "maximizing productivity". Here is some steps up the focus technique hierarchy:
### Step 0 - recognize
First you have to realize you're not focusing on what you should be. You have to [[Know Your Immediate Task]], then have enough awareness To recognize you're not doing it. 
### Step 1 - understand 
Next you should try to determine the [[Reason You're Procrastinating]]. Is it more to avoid the discomfort of doing the thing or because the distraction seems genuinely more important?
### Step 2 - five minute rule
If you're avoiding the discomfort of focusing on the difficult task, just lean into it for 5 minutes. Just [[Commit for a Bit]], then you can take a break.
### Step 3 - the [[Pomodoro Technique üçÖ]]
This is something you cannot do until you can commit for a bit. Trying to jump straight into a full 25 minutes (or whatever your timer is set for) can be too much. I've done this.
### Step 4 - [[Time Blocking]]
This is where you're reaching the pinnacle of productivity and focus. **This requires a well-honed ability to focus**. Trying to jump straight into time blocking does not work. But, if you're finding yourself *not* being too avoidant of the tasks you're on, if you've mastered the ability to commit for a decent chunk of time, then you can move into the realm of scheduling focus sessions in advance.
