Map your projects to your goals, and both of those to your areas. Literally draw lines between them. This enlightening technique brings clarity to your big picture.

## **If your project does not have an associated goal, it’s a hobby**.

**If your project does not have an associated goal, it’s a hobby**. 

If your goal does not have an associated project, it’s a dream. 

Hobbies and dreams can be fine too, but they shouldn’t go unrecognized as such.

If a [[Defining Project|project]] or goal is supporting multiple areas, then it deserves special attention.

If an area has no projects or goals, it's coasting - which may be fine, but again shouldn't go unrecognized as such.
