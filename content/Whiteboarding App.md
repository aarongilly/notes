There a ton of options for Whiteboarding Applications. I wrote fairly extensively about them, including a [[Decision Matrix]], in [Column #430](https://aarongilly.com/430/). Here's a distilled summary of those apps I still consider useful from time to time.

### Figjam
By the makers of Figma. This one is great, yet I don't use it much. It's a bit too slow to start and requires a connection.
### Freeform
By Apple. This one is *probably* the best one for the iPad. It's missing some pretty obvious features, though. Labeled connectors, for one.

### GoodNotes
This is not a Whiteboarding app, but can be used like one. It's a notebook app that I'm very comfortable using. It's fine.
GoodNotes doodles blow up huge.
### Concepts
This is a drawing app with an infinite whiteboard-like canvas. Its layering is a nice bonus feature.

### [[Excalidraw]]
I still love this one. It's [[Open Source]].

### [[DrawIO]]
Less of an whiteboarding app than it is a *diagramming* app. It's open source. Less great at free-form stuff, but is the only one from the above that supports multiple pages & hyperlinking.

### [[Obsidian]] Canvases
While Obsidian is best for notetaking, [[Obsidian Canvas]] feature could be useful. Zero support for freeform drawing, though.
