**Look for situations in which a group can become more than the sum of its parts.**

Habit 6 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Synergize

So far as I know, Stephen Covey came up with the concept of synergy. It's not well-defined in this book, either. Basically it's too look for situations in which a group can become more than the sum of its parts. 

**This takes trust between group members**. People have to feel safe. This is called [[Psychological Safety]]. (see: [[Vulnerability ]])  For a group of individuals to truly synergize they need a diverse set of experiences, skills, and background ([[Diversity]])
