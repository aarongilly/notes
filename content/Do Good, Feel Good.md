**To be good and feel good, do good.**

The Stoics and the Buddhists don't believe in original sin. They don't believe we are born flawed. They believe "act natural" and "do the right thing" say the same thing. If there is a situation pointed south, and you have the power to do something about it - it is your responsibility. If you want to be good, and feel good, you must do good.
