**Be selective with what technology you choose to integrate into your life.**

Like anything else, the tenants of [[Minimalism]] can be applied to the integration of technology in our lives. More is not always better ( [[Less, but Better]] )

## Amish

Do not reject all technology. Mini, to most, of them have selected pieces of technology that have been carefully chosen to uphold their values and provide them with more value. They do not own a car because the cost of owning a car outweigh the benefit of owning a car in their eyes. Costs like always running to the store instead of using their local shop.

## Digital Decluttering

A minimalist practice that involves weeding out technology from your life unless it actually adds more value than it takes.

## **The Digital World Disables Serendipity**

The author of The Organized Mind has a nostalgic view of the benefits of physical organization, such as a library. The act of physical browsing enables serendipity.
