During the process you take to achieve your goals, you're likely to run into fodder for new, more ambitious goals. When you achieve your original goal, you may not even notice -- being distracted by your new, more advanced goalposts. You don't celebrate wins. You don't see yourself as having summited the mountain, because there's a new peak above. This sets up a never ending wheel of pursuit, without a satisfactory ending. 

> [!warning] Beware sliding goalposts!

The **sliding goalpost phenomenon** happens in every [[Defining Area|area]] of life. 

- When it comes to money, there's "the Joneses" and the [[Diderot Effect]].
- When it comes to fitness, there's a never ending comparison to the next biggest guy, or focusing on weak spots

## What to do instead

Recognize that [[Feeling "On Top" of Life]] is not a realistic goal. There is such a thing as [[Enough]] productivity. There is such a thing as [[Enough Money]]. 

- Use the [[3-3-3 Method]] and [[3 Goals a Day]], don't let yourself feel like you didn't do enough when you go to sleep.
- Set [[SMART Goals]] that *can* be unambiguously completed.
- Don't let goals and *grow*. If you must, set new ones, keep the originals, & **celebrate** when they're done.
- [[Compare Yourself to Your Average]], because [[Trajectory Matters More Than Results]]
- Do your very best to [[Elements of Enjoyment|enjoy]] and [[Love the Process]]
