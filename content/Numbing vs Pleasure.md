**A lot of the things that bring us joy, we also turn to when we need to numb our feelings. You should know which you're doing.**

There's a number of things we do to numb feelings that we also just do for pure joy. Watch TV. Drink. Chat online. Play games. 

The difference between numbing and pleasure: the intention. If you're flipping through channels, you're numbing. If you're watching a show you love and engaging with it, you're doing it wholeheartedly. Per [[Pleasure vs Enjoyment]] â€” it takes energy to enjoy something.
