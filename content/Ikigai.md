**Your reason for being.**

The Japanese of Okinawa are the oldest living people in the world. This book attributes that fact to the notion of "ikigai" which is basically "your reason for being." When you have a reason to get up, you're more happy. When you don't have a good reason to get up, you may not.

Work, volunteering, a passion project, and nurturing relationships are all good reasons to get out of bed in the morning.
