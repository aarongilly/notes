**A technique for identifying failures before they occur.**

When undertaking a project, in particular a *group* project, it is a useful practice to ask yourselves to write a hypothetical "Post-Mortem" that takes place one month after the project has completely failed. Ask group members to write, from their perspective, what the thing was that caused the failure. This gets everyone's biggest concerns out and on the table, and can force you to consider thing you might have otherwise overlooked.
