**The belief that data is the ultimate good.**

The belief that data is the be-all end-all truth of the universe. Organisms and collective societies are data processing system, with in-built algorithms honed through millennia of natural selection. Capitalism uses distributed processing. Communism utilizes a central processor. Dataists believe the key to a better world is the freedom of information, and the rapid proliferation of connections between data processors. Regardless of whether it's correct, it is capable of incredible power & influence.  The [[Future of the Quantified Self]] is a dataist utopia. The total eradication of humans in support of a better race of beings is a dataist dystopia (at least from our perspective).
