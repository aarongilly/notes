**Ignoring evidence that contradicts your coherent view of a person or situation. A form of confirmation bias.**

As we start learning about a subject (person, event, etc) we begin formalizing opinions about it immediately. Sort of like the how the first voice in a crowd has a disproportionate effect on the opinion eventually reached by that crowd - the first things you start to learn wind up taking precedence in your head over things you learn later.

Looks like [[Confirmation Bias]] and contributes to the [[Noise of Crowds]] (i.e. not wisdom of crowds).
