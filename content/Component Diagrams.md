**Component Diagrams represent system architecture, focusing on interface relationships.**

One of the [[Main UML Diagrams]], Component Diagrams represent system architecture. They are all about interfaces. What provides them, what requires them. In so doing, it represents the [[modularity]] of the system.

Components are responsible for one clear thing and interact with each other on a need-to-know basis.  Components have required and provided interfaces and also [[UML Ports]]  (which are often associated with interfaces).
