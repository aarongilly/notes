Because [[Goals Alone Don't Get Results]], I am working a personal [[Management Operating System|MOS]] to:
1. Minimize missed responsibilities
2. Minimize [[Productive Distraction]]
3. Be done with uncertainty around where to do things (see: [[Solved Problems List]])
4. [[Connecting Areas, Projects, & Goals]]
5. Perform a [[Commitment Inventory]] to ensure I'm not over-extending my ambitions beyond the [[Essentialism|essential]] things.
