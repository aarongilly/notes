In response to their competitor's technology-based market initiatives, UPS developed an [[Enterprise Architecture]] reflecting their company's [[What is a Strategy|strategy]]. It included several [[Make the Decision that Informs all Subsequent Decisions]].

The CIO decided there should be a *single package database* and a global telecom capability for package data to be captured & accessed from anywhere it might go. Rules were put in place to enforce certain standard be upheld and IT was given the authority to enforce them. 
The business side's senior management defined four **core processes**: package delivery, product development, customer relationship management, and customer information management. They then standardized tasks within these processes.
