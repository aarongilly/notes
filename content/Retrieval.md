**When it comes to learning things, having to recall content *from memory* is better than simply reviewing the content**

There is an unambiguous link between having to remember a thing right now, and your ability to remember it later. This is a form of [[Direct Learning]], in effect. You trying to recall something now is *directly* doing the thing that you'll be doing later when you need to remember it. You aren't able to lull yourself into a false sense of 'having learned' due to the [[Mere Exposure Effect]]. Retrieval is an example of [[Desired Difficulty]].

## Retrieval Tactics
- Flash Cards & Spaced Repetition Systems
- Free recall - write down something you just finished listening to
- Close the book
