**Cue → [Craving →] Response → Reward**

## Source
- [[Atomic Habits]]
- [[The Power of Habit]]

Per [[The Power of Habit ]]  - the Habit Loop consists of three parts. Cue → Response→ reward.

[[Atomic Habits]]  expands on this framework, interjecting “Craving” between cue and response. Otherwise the definitions of each part of the loop remain the same.

# Definitions

1. Cue - What triggers the behavior. Can be external or internal.
2. Craving - the anticipation of the behavior that takes place between the cue and the behavior itself
3. Response - The behavior itself. What we are thinking of when we think “habit”.
4. Reward - Whatever the result of the habit is. Serves to lessen discomfort.
