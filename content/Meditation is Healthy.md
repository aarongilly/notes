Science has begun to take seriously the study of meditation. Early results (as reported on by [[Dan Harris]] , a massive proponent of meditation) showed that meditation can be associated with:

- Reduced stress levels
- Reduced blood pressure
- Boosting the immune system
- Mitigating depression
- Expanding (literally) the areas of your brain associated with compassion & self-awareness
- Shutting up the voice in your head
