**We think of ourselves as our internal narrator. That’s not us, that’s our thoughts. We are more than our thoughts will ever be.**

Humans are often inclined to say that the little narrative going on in their head **IS** who they are.. but you are not your thoughts - you are the whole person thinking them. Don't give every thought the same weight. You are not a sad person, you are a full person who is feeling sadness right now. This is very meditative.
