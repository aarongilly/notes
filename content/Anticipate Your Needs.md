**Enable yourself to take advantage of deals & discounts.**

Look for when things you actually know you need and will use are actually on sale. Shop in bulk. Learn how much things cost. Look for deals. 

An echo of [[Parkinson's Law]]: 
"Needs" expand to encompass whatever you want to buy on impulse.
