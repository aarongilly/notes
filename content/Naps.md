**The right kind of naps can be an effective way to maintain performance.**

Naps get a bad rap. They're phenomenal, though. There is all sorts of evidence (which I have not noted) supporting the highly positive ROI for taking a *good* nap. 

## "Taking a nap" & "going to sleep" are not synonymous

The trick a nap to get in and out before sleep inertia can kick in. Sleep inertia is when your body starts to go into the mode of deep sleep. If you hit that threshold, waking up can be a hard thing to do. You'll feel more tired *after* your nap than before you went in.

> [!tip] **An ideal nap:**
Go to a designated napping spot. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Aim to sleep for 10-20 of those minutes. If possible, chug coffee RIGHT before and have a "Nappuccino".
