**`= this.summary`**

The concept of "ego depletion" was coined during an initial study into people's willpower and ability to maintain it. The original study suggested that willpower may simply be available glucose in the brain. This has had mixed results on further studies and remains a slightly controversial topic in psychology today. But what's clear is that these factors **will** limit your ability to exert your willpower:

- fatigue - lack of sleep, or overexetion
- pain - physical and emotional pain
- **distraction** - being distracted makes you LESS LIKELY to have the willpower to do what needs doing
