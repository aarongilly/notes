> [!tldr] Probably three 30 minute runs per week.

How much cardio is "[[enough]]" to reap the health benefits?

The first article I found says:
> Running for 20 to 30 minutes, or about a mile-and-a-half to three miles, twice per week would appear to be perfect.

How much cardio is enough **to see improvements in your ability to run**?

Most articles I find seem to suggest a minimum of 30 minutes, 3 days per week.
> If we focus on running specifically, the general consensus amongst experts is that you need to run at least three days per week to improve

[[Lagging Measures]] - Results take time:
It can take **4 to 6 weeks** to notice changes in your aerobic ability and for the actual training effect being felt.
