Stonewalling is essentially shutting down and refusing to engage, this mode of behavior closes off an opportunity for learning and growth.

Stonewalling (referred to by Brene Brown as "disengagement") is a defense mechanism for [[Vulnerability ]]. It is a betray of disengagement. It's the first sign of troubles in a trusted relationship. It triggers [[Shame]] and the deepest fears of being unworthy of love or trust.
