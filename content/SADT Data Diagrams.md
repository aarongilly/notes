**IDEF0â€™s ancestor had data diagrams, too.**

SADT has Activity diagrams, which are essentially exactly what [[IDEF0]] is, but also Data Modeling diagrams, which look similar but have slightly different semantics. 

The semantics of arrows for data:

- Inputs are activities that produce the data.
- Outputs consume the data.
- Controls influence the internal state of the data.
