summary: Areas for Metrics May Be Different from Areas for Reference
---
**`= this.summary`**

While I originally believed that the same set of "Area"s would be useful for both establishing [[Metrics]] against **and** for associativity to [[Note Types#Area Notes]], I've come to learn that they might be better off being slightly different lists. "Creativity" is an area to maintain, but individual creative domains may have their own [[Note Types#Logs]]

Goals & Metrics:
- Relationship
- Career

Reference:
* Spousal doctor visits, e.g.
* Specific projects/sub-domains within your career
