**Casting forward to the imagined worst-case scenario.**

Papa√±ca is the casting forward of the mind to the imagined worst-case scenario. It doesn't really do you any good, and adds stress. This is a specific type of [[Anticipatory Anxiety]]. One that you of probably stop doing. 

## Example

- If I don't get this assignment in on time, I'll get fired. Since I'm fired then I'll lose all my money, lose the house. My wife will leave me.
