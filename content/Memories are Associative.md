**Like the brain, memories work by associations.**

Memories are related to each other. If you remember a fact in a location, you're more likely to recall that fact in that location.

This is one of the negative aspects of multitasking and why you should [[Never Multitask]], If you're doing 3 things you may need to remember all at once, the memories will not be made cleanly. 

Memories of special events stick out mostly because they arenâ€™t competing against any (or many) other memories. Memories of routines become genericized. This is why you can't remember what you had for breakfast yesterday - unless it was something weird.
