**It's better to consistently make okay progress than to make bursty progress with periods of feast and famine.**

When it comes to [[Morale Responsiveness]], it is probably my better to be non-responsive (aka not dependent on) having a high morale. If you can consistently make a little bit of progress, and use [[Time Blocking]] to ONLY make that amount of progress, you will end up being more productive with less time spent, cumulatively. Also you won't be as susceptible to depression regarding your work.
