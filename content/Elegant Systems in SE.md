**8 Properties of “Elegance” to aim for with our systems**

According to Dr. Mike Griffin, it’s the main job of a Systems Engineer to ensure these properties are achieved and balanced.

**Workability** - the system produces the anticipated behavior, the expected output

**Robustness** - the system should not produce radical departures from its expected behavior in response to small changes

**Efficiency** - produces the desired output for what is thought to be a lesser expenditure of resources than competing alternatives

**Predictability** - accomplishes its intended purpose while minimizing unintended actions, side effects, and consequences

**Functional Compliance** - performs the functions we desire at or above the expected level of performance

**Simple Architecture** - the structural arrangement of the physical parts of form with only essential [[System Complexity]]

**Minimal Lifecycle Cost** - including the design effort, manufacturing cost, capital expenditures, operating expenses

**Superior Lifecycle Properties** - robustness, safety, flexibility to change, maintainability, sustainability...
