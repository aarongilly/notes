> [!tldr] **Establishing a goal isn't as important as establishing a system to achieve it.**

Goal setting is good, but systems should be the real focus. **Setting goals is not the determining factor for whether you achieve them.** People who succeed and people who fail to win a race all set the same goal (to win it). Setting goals doesn't not cause them to be achieved nearly as much as setting the systems in place to achieve them.
