**Sunday** - [[Zone 2]] cardio for 60-75 minutes
**Monday** - Legs: 2 sets each for hams, quads, and calves
**Tuesday** - Deliberate heat and cold exposure. 20 minutes hot. 5 minutes cold. repeated several times.
**Wednesday** - Torso: 2 sets each for chest, back, shoulders, and some for neck
**Thursday** - ~35 minutes of cardio in the zone 3-4 range of your [[Heart Rate Zones]]
**Friday** - HIIT: those fan bikes, rowing, sprints, etc. ~8 to 12 rounds of 30 seconds all-out with *just barely enough* rest between.
**Saturday** - Arms, calves, neck

### Exercises & Sets
Huberman's likes to have at least 2 sets per muscle group per workout, and to have one set of each where focus on *weighted stretching* and the other focus more on *weighted contraction*. This gives the muscle work over its full range of motion.

Example: 
- weighted stretching -> incline curl
- weighted contraction -> concentration curl

### Periodicity
Huberman follows a monthly [[Fitness Periodic Meta Routine]].
