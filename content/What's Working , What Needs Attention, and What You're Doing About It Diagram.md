summary: A graphical cross-area technique I did that was informative.

In the service of deriving [[Goals (index)|goals]] for 2024 and formalizing (or codifying) my [[Personal MOS]], I did a thing that was interesting. For the sake of me potentially publishing these notes, this is a generalized representation & fictitious example:

![[Untitled-2024-01-10-1414.excalidraw.svg]]

## Process
1. Put all life [[Defining Area|area]]s in boxes in rough proximity to each other on a whiteboarding application like [[Excalidraw]]
2. Place color-coded labels around each area for:
	1. things you're doing
	3. aspects of the area (e.g. [[Metrics]])
	2. tools you're using
3. AFTER doing all of the above... add in "..and what you're doing about it" bubbles.
 
Basically, anything in green is something you should celebrate & keep around. Anything in red needs some form of attention. After thinking about the red labels, try to come up with some concrete things you'll use to try to improve them. Those are the blue labels.
