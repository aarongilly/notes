**"Am I Willing At This Time to make the investment required to make a positive difference on this topic?" - the first principle of becoming the person you want to be**

Marshall Goldsmith's "First Principle of Becoming the Person You Want to Be":

> Am I willing at this time to make the investment required to make a positive difference on this topic?

In short: "AIWATT".

It's all about inserting a delay to think between stimulus (environment) and response (behavior).

Better: Trigger > Impulse > AIWATT > Considered Behavior
