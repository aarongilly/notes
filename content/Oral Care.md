## Routine

At least 2x/day:
1. Floss (with real floss)
2. Mouthwash
3. Brush
4. (Don't rinse!)

## Supplies

Electric toothbrush beats regular. But CHANGE THE HEADS to ensure you aren't using bristles that have gone too firm.

Regular floss is best. 

Use mouthwash without Alcohol, as that dries out your mouth.

## Extra Stuff
### Food & Drink

Regular exposure to carbs is not good. Total exposure matters less than frequency of exposure. Sipping a soda all day is much worse than downing one with dinner. Coffee isn't great either, due to its acidity.

#### pH
Oral [[pH (Potential of Hydrogen)]] balance is important. In particular having too many acids can lead to bad oral health outcomes. Coffee is acidic. ðŸ˜Ÿ

### [[Mouth Breathing]]
Don't. You don't want your mouth to dry out. Saliva helps maintain oral health. Certain kinds of gums are actually *helpful* due to their pro-salivation properties.
