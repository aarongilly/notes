**Functions take inputs, perform perform operations, and my return outputs**

The concept of a **function** is vital to math, computer programming, and engineering - but it can easily be extrapolated to cover any aspect of life. A simple definition of "function" is a thing that provides a consistent output, wholly dependent on the set of inputs it's given. 

### WIkipedia definition:

`A function is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set.`

# Nomenclature & Terminology

In all domains of use, functions are sometimes named and sometimes not. Mathematical functions can be referred to by their algorithm, such as:

$$
f(x) = 2x + 1
$$

Or, for well-known algorithms, by a name - such as:

The Quadratic Formula

### Argument

The inputs to the function.

### Domain

The whole set of possible inputs for each argument.

### Range

The whole set of possible outputs.

### Arity/Degree

The number of arguments the function depends on to produce its result.

### Return

The result of a function. Its output.
