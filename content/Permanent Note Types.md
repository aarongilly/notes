From [[Andy Matuschak]]'s public notes - he breaks down what I call 'Permanent Notes' into a series of different types. These are his, in order of increasingly developed as you go down:
- Stubs - not full notes
- Definitions
- Bridges - spanning related notes
- Narrow, declarative notes - e.g. his 'Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims' note.
- Questions - if no conclusions are drawn
- APIs - whaaa? I don't understand his explanation on these
- Abstractions of many other notes ([[Inductive vs Deductive|Inductive Reasoning]])
- Outlines - preparing to convert [[Intermediate Packets]] into content
