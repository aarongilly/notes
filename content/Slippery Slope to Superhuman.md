**Creating Superhumans is the same Pandora's Box as creating nukes.**

It’s almost inevitable that we’ll be super humans. The same technologies that we are currently researching to cure and prevent diseases, regain memories for Alzheimer’s patients, and enable the disabled, and restore limbs to amputees would be able to used to enhance and augment our natural abilities. Moreover, once it’s possible - you won’t be able to be *sure* that “the other guys” are doing it, and we’ll be in the same situation we’re in now with Weapons of Mass Destruction. This is a case of [[The Prisoner's Dilemma]].

The status quo for medicine and sociology has been to ensure freedom from famine, plague, and war. This is slowly changing to a status quo which is aimed at more than just [[Ending War, Famine, & Plague]] - but a world of immortal beings who are ceaselessly in bliss. These superhuman, super intelligent, super feeling beings may rightfully be considered more valuable. At which point, there won't be as much importance placed on protection Homo Sapiens ([[The Future of Human Importance]])... and those best qualified to do the protection will be those who don't need it.
