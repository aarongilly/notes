**Starting plans for future expenses from zero, rather than from the pre-existing plan, to avoid the [[Sunk Cost Bias]].**

Zero-Based Budgeting is a financial technique that avoids the sunk-cost bias. Rather than plan your future expenditures starting from what the pre-existing plan said, you start from zero. Everything you had previously committed to needs to be re-committed to if it's truly still worth it.

This can (and should) also be done with goals and planned usage of time. Just because you *were* going to do something doesn't mean it is necessarily the best thing to do still.
