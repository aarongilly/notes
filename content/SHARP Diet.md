**An acronym for a brain-protecting diet.**

The mediterranean diet seems to be great. And his acronym is ‘eating SHARP’

S - Slash sugar (no added sugar… frankly limit natural sugars too)

H - Hydrate smartly (you shouldn’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink)

A - Add more Omega 3s from natural sources

R - Reduce Portions (you shouldn’t ever feel “full”)

P - Plan Ahead - don’t eat just whatever’s convenient

## A Better Breakfast

Rather than a bagel or cereal, try one of these:

- Egg Frittata, with lots of veggies and whole-grain toast topped with almond butter.
- Steel Cut Oatmeal with Cinnamon, Berries, and a Drizzle of Honey
- Greek Yogurt, plain, with berries and blueberries, and tablespoon of real maple syrup
- No juices. Water or black coffee. Smoothies and juices pass through the small intestine too soon and you don’t absorb them well enough.
