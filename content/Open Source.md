**A philosophical approach to collaborative coding**

Open source is literally *open source code*. You can see the underlying code that makes the thing go. Almost always that's stored in [[Git]]Hub nowadays. 

Open Source products remove some of the risk inherent in putting things that are important to you into someone else's app. There's less of a risk of malicious code, and less risk of the developers deciding they want to shut their doors and you're left with files that cannot be opened.

Some of my favorite products are open-source. Some, like Obsidian here, are not. ☹️
