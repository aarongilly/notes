Process Specs describe what must be done to transform inputs into outputs. There is no one technique that can claim it is "The Method" of Process Specification. There are a large number of techniques that can be used to specify a process. Many of which I've written notes about already. Whatever method chosen, it needs to serve the purpose of documenting (& communicating) *intent*.  

- A simple narrative using no formal rules/constraints
	- Dispreferred over structured text
- A structured narrative using [[Other Forms of Checklist|Template]]s & rules
- Pseudo-code (or actual code)
- Decision trees
- [[Flow Charts]]
- [[BPMN]]
- [[Activity Diagrams]]
- [[IDEF3]] diagrams
- [[OPM]] diagrams, although these are probably outmoded by others on this list

Both [[IDEF0]] and [[Data Flow Diagram|DFD Diagrams]] call for the use of some form of Process Spec to expand on their limitations.
