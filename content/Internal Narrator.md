**The voice you hear when you think.**

When you think, you’re hearing words in your head. Those words are coming from what I’m going to call your ‘Internal Narrator.’ This is the person who can’t stop living in the past or worrying about the future. This is the person who has fears and worries.

[[You Aren’t Your Thoughts, You’re Their Thinker]].

[[Meditation]] is about learning how to silence the internal narrator to help live in the [[Mindfulness & Now]] [[Presence]].
