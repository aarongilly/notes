**You don't have to hate yourself to want to improve yourself.**

A pitfall of the process of self-improvement is accidentally growing a distainment for the person you are now. You do not have to hate something to want it to change. As a matter of fact, quite the opposite is true. You can both love something, and try to make it better. What more could love possibly mean?

Enjoy [[Presence]]. Do not put off satisfaction until you've achieved a goal. [[Love the Process]].   

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘Œ You can love yourself for who you are and want to be better too.
