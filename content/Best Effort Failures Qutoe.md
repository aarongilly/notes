**Failure is most useful when you give your best effort.**

> Failure is most useful when you give your best effort. If you fail with lackluster effort, you haven't learned much. Perhaps you could have succeeded with a proper [[focus]]. 
> But if your best effort fails, you have learned something valuable: this way doesn't work.
