**Just do it.**

Nike's slogan is a great life motto.

> Just Do It. - Nike

Don't think about it. Don't worry about it. Don't feel the need to for certainty that it's right. Don't waste time and energy planning. Don't try to make it perfect. Don't wait. Just do it.

It's the best way to learn. It's the best way to produce big results in the long run. It's the fastest and best way to be.
