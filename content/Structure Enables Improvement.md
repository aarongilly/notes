**Without structure, we tend to revert to default behaviors** according to our environment and circumstances. This may be okay when you're already "good enough" in a given domain (see: [[Satisficing]]), but it doesn't really allow for any sort of personal growth to take place. Sometimes [[Good is the Enemy of Great]].

> [!tip] ***Structure provides the needed framework around which improvements can be built***.

If you want to [[Build On Yourself]] you have to pick up where you left off last time, not start from scratch each time. You need a standard place to incorporate improvements (see: [[Standardization Enables Creativity]] and [[Periodic Reviews]]). 

Structure allows for the repetition and accumulation of marginal gains to happen often enough to get [[Traction]] to make a real difference (see:  [[Habits Have Compounding Returns]]).
