**Rather than a checklist to handle the little things, a communications checklist ensures the big things are covered.**

When constructing skyscrapers, the companies that organize and carry out their build utilize massively detailed schedules, which are effectively just checklist of things that need to happen in the right sequence.... this makes sure all the little, obvious things go right... but they also utilize communications [[Checklists]] that specify when certain conversations between certain groups with specialized scope and expertise should talk about specific topics. This type of checklist **ensures the right conversations are happening.** It is at a higher level than the “get the little steps right” checklist, but every bit as important.
