**When it comes to programming, modeling, and spec writing - don't repeat yourself.**

When at all possible - keep your code, models, and specifications DRY. That is to say, don't write the same things over and over. Don't repeat yourself. Don't repeat yourself.

This is a best practice because it consolidates logic into a [[single source of truth]].

## Benefits of DRY code/docs include:

- Propagation of changes by reference
- Fewer hours spent copy/pasting during refactoring efforts
- Fewer error traps

## Caveats/Drawbacks of DRY code:

- Sometimes repeating yourself is easier to do and easier to understand
- Lists of references & pointers that don't actually pull the content (or at least a summary thereof) are effectively useless by themselves and put the work on the reader (in the case of documentation)
- It requires foresight or early-on refactoring
