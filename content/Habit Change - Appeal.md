**Enable good habits by finding ways to make them appealing, and dissuade bad ones by making them disgusting.**

If you can make the process of carrying out a new, desired habit more appealing, you're more likely to do it. Likewise, making a bad habit less appealing can make you more likely to successfully break it. Finding how to do these things is the tricky part.

For bad habits, you can focus on the negative emotions you feel when you give into the habit. Instead of trying to avoid the habit for the habit's sake, avoid it because of the disappointment or disgust you'll feel after you've done it.

To make good habits more appealing, try [[Temptation Bundling]].

Do not bundle a temptation that casts votes against the habit you're trying to instill. The gym should not be paired with ice cream. Artistic creation should not be paired with passive consumption. 

## Other Example

When I make coffee (something I want to do), I will moisturize my hands (something I need to do).
