**Apply [[Direct Learning]], figure out what's your [[Rate Determining Step]], figure out how you can drill just that with [[Deliberate Practice]]. Then go back to [[Direct Learning]]**

Don't spend all your time doing drills, or you might end up wasting all of your time on things that don't transfer to the practical application. But also don't spend all of your time doing the whole thing if one small part is what's primarily holding up your progress. The right approach is to go through cycles of #[[Direct Learning]], doing [[Pareto Analysis]], figuring out how to use [[Deliberate Practice]] (drilling), then going back to direct learning.
