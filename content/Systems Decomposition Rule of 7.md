**Number of levels of decomposition needed for a system is about log_7(number of parts)**

Humans aren't good at handling over 7 pieces of information at once. Thus, the number of levels of composition a system requires is best pegged at around $\log_7({number\space of\space parts}) \approx number\space of\space levels\space of\space decomposition$.

Basically, how many times can you divide the number of components by 7? That's the number of system levels you probably should look at using.
