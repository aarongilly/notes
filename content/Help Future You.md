**Making things easier for you later helps you later, AND helps you now.**

It is difficult to carry important ideas through time. Clarity is a fleeting asset. It takes a lot of [[Context Loading]] to achieve. 

Have a habit of pre-processing ideas, tasks, and making those things easier for yourself to pick back up on at a later date. This will help you achieve more, faster, when you eventually come around to the content again - but it will *also* help you achieve clarity now. You’ll be more engaged with what’s on your plate, and you’ll likely be able to pre-ordain success.
