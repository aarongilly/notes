**Candles. Warm colors. Many small lights. **

Danes love candles. Danish people burn 6+ kilos of candle wax each year. Not for the scent, most Danes don't use scented candles, but for the ambiance. 

Lamps too, are very important. The cooler the lamp, the better. He measured it in kelvin. 

The danish winter is long. It rains more days than it doesn't. Hence lamps and candles are a big deal.

Small distributed zones of light are usually better than one big central light.
