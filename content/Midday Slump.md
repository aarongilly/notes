**Most people experience a peak around noon, then a trough until ~5, then recover**

Not all times of the day are created equal. Energy, [[focus]], physical readiness, and mental acuity ebb and flow through the day, following predictable patterns. For the majority of the population, we begin the day strong, then have a slump around 6-8 hours after we wake up, then end the day strong.

## Effects:

- [[Decision Fatigue]]  - people will start relying on biases and prejudices more
- Attention wanes
- Mistakes are made

## Scary example

There are significant effects of the mid-afternoon slump in hospitals everywhere. You're 3x more likely to be killed by your anestesia. Staff are 10% less likely to have washed their hands, causing infection rates to rise.  Colonoscopies find fewer cancerous growths.

### Timing Tips

- Schedule your important work early in the day, or later in the evening. ([[Eat the Frog]])
- Schedule doctor's appointments, interviews, and collaborative meetings early, too.
- Take breaks.
