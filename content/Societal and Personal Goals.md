**We do what we want, but also what society makes us want.**

We put off personal satisfaction partially because society demands we do so. We are sold things we don't really need because society says that's what brings us success and promises contentment. We shouldn't give into our most basic, "lizard-brain" instincts all the time because we couldn't live harmoniously in groups without some of those things in check. Yet simultaneously, we cannot achieve a personally satisfying life by simply doing anything and everything that society deems so. **The best bet, per usual, is a balance between extremes**. You should have a balance between your intrinsic desires and those that only really exist to serve the masses.

## Example

- Analyze what you want and why - is it truly something that would bring value to your life? Or is it just something you "feel" like you should have.
