**A metric for considering how to handle your money & retirement.**

The main metric I perceived that was focused on in the book “Money Magic”. What is the greatest total amount of money you can choose to spend in your life. Looking at things through this lens does seem like a helpful method from time to time. 

The book itself, though, did this to a hilarious level and made the entire concept almost seem silly.
