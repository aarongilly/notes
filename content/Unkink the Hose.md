**Before simply "trying harder", remove obstacles.**

When it comes to achieving results - spend more effort FIRST by removing existing obstacles BEFORE spending it trying to push harder for the result. You can only "try harder" for so long before succumbing to burnout or reverting back to your normal baseline effort. A lasting, non-stressful way to achieve the exact same ends is to focus on making the means **easier** by removing obstacles.

This goes not only for personal development, but also for performance in business systems, teams, and anything else. A group of hikers is only as fast as the slowest hiker. Making that persons load lighter can speed the entire group.
