**There’s no faster way to get a better understanding of a process than by doing it yourself.**

Theoretical learning is lazy. It is too easy when reading or listening to a lecture about a subject or process to accept what’s given to you at face value, and not realize that you don’t understand what it is, means, or how it works. You’re subject to the [[Mere Exposure Effect]]. You can't learn to ride a bicycle without training wheels by keeping yours on and studying theory. You take them off and learn by doing. It's more painful, but much more effective.

### Identifying Paramedics Example

There was a study in which experienced paramedics, newly trained paramedics, and their teachers were shown videos of people doing CPR. Some videos showed an experienced paramedic, some showed the newly trained folks. The assignment of the individual was to categorize whether the person in each video was experienced or whether they were new & recently trained.

The experienced folks were 90% accurate in picking out other experienced folks. The newly trained folks were essentially just randomly guessing. The teachers did WORSE than randomly guessing. They were divorced from the reality of doing CPR in a real setting, and accounting for what would be best for the situation, and instead focusing on who executed the steps just as they were told.

There is a gap between academically “understanding” a thing and actually “knowing” the thing. Bridging the gap requires doing, not planning. 

## Techniques

If it’s a process, do it. 

If it’s a subject, teach it.

If it’s an idea, write about it.
