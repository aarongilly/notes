summary: a brief deliberate period of exposure to icy water for various benefits 
---
**`= this.summary`**

Dr. Andrew Huberman loves deliberate cold exposure as a tool for increasing baseline levels of [[Dopamine]], spiking your [[Adrenaline]]and [[Noradrenaline]], and increasing discipline.

Forcing this upon yourself also is a way to train your top-down control, increasing your ability to maintain discipline and do other hard things. 

Huberman recommends **11 minutes per week** for maximum benefit.
