**High Expectation & little control is a recipe for a depressed workforce (or child).**

High expectations and low control lead to worker depression. High expectations are okay, even necessary, but they must be accompanied by appropriate levels of autonomy and control over their fate.

The same principle applies to raising children. Expectations are okay, but they need some semblance of control of something in their lives. Without that control, they are more likely to have unhealthy relationships with videogames or TV, and are more likely to be incarcerated as adults. 

This was done in a study, talked about in Indistractable. The same section made the comparison to child rearing.
