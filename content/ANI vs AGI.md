**Artificial Narrow/General Intelligence**

All of our current-day artificially intelligent systems use Artificial **Narrow** Intelligence (ANI). This means their intelligence is set about a narrow set of well-defined goals in a relatively small domain. We are working our way, inevitably, toward Artificial **General** Intelligence, where a machine is capable of setting its own intermediary goals in pursuit of its prime directive.

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ **ANI:** 
Goal - Look at this picture, does it have a cat in it?
Result - No.
**AGI:** 
Goal - Maximize the number of paperclips.
Result - Sorry I destroyed the world & conquered the universe to make more paperclips
