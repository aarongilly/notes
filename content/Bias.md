**A misplacement in judgment or a systems output in a consistent direction**

Like [[Noise]], bias contributes to error (see [[Reducing Noise and Reducing Bias]]). Unlike noise, bias doesn't do so *randomly*. 

Humans are biased. Systems can be biased. Bias is a clinical, technical, and societal term and in every sense it means a deviation from correctness in a consistent manner.
