**Index. Day, Future, & Month logs. Trackers. Lists.**

## Index

Keep track of what's in your book and where. Also keeps track of what your paying attention to from a high-level. Useful when you've got more than one volume. Index is roughly 4 pages of *collections* in a list.

## Collections

- Day log - rapid logs kept throughout a day. Just the date at the top and a rapid log until tomorrow. Not indexed.
- Future Log - grouping of many upcoming months in a box. Write stuff in the months that it has to happen.
- Month Log - sequential listing of days, across from a task list for the month. Write down what you did *after* you've done it.
- Special collections - food trackers, lists of various types, all sorts of things can be done.
