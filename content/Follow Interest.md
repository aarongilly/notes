**Following what is interesting is a way to ensure long-term success & a satisfactory journey.**

Usually a learner fails not because of a lack of ability, but because of a lack of interest. They fail to see how or why what they are learning will be relevant or useful to them in their lives. When the study becomes meaningless, it becomes a chore. When it becomes a chore, we cease to do it (or, at least we cease to do it with passion). It takes excitement and passion to accomplish big things. So follow your interests where they take you.

> Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually **be** in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant. - Tiago Forte

Long-lasting motivation depends on making forward progress consistently. This is the benefit of breaking problems and projects down into smaller, more manageable steps. In the case of study, discovery, and research, it enables us to quickly make progress, then review the current landscape and decide what the next most-promising area is to go explore. Following insight becomes the driving force of the work, and the work doesn't feel like *work*. 

> As in martial arts, if you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it but instead redirect it towards another productive goal. -Tiago Forte
