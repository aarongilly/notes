**Make habits 2 minutes or less so they stick.**

It is often better to make a small version of a habit that you can follow rather than the full version that you won’t follow. Don’t commit to reading a chapter a night, commit to picking up the book and reading one page. More often than not, you’ll wind up reading a lot more. You will pick up the book intending to do only your two minutes, then realize you’re 20 minutes in and enjoying yourself. 

**Ultimately you’ll get a lot more reading done by committing to a page a night than you would if you told yourself to do a chapter a night.** 

It’s easy to do anything for 2 minutes. Even if you’re tired. Or stressed.
