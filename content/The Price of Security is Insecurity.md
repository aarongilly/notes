**Dan Harris's mantra, that's helpful to an extent, but unhealthy in extremes. **

This is a central question in [[10% Happier]]. Author [[Dan Harris]] is a self proclaimed neurotic. He credited his neuroticism with a lot of his successes in life, but also with this unceasing dissatisfaction and unhappiness. How do you become Zen, without becoming useless, or a punching bag? Ultimately his conclusion is that there is some merit in the phrase, but **you have to learn to draw the line when worry and insecurities are no longer actually helping.** He credits the mantras "is this helpful?" along with "what's most important". This, ultimately, is about balance.
