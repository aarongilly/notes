> [!success] Hello world!

What you're reading here are [[My Notes]]. They cover whatever topics I feel like. I wrote them using [[Obsidian]], although they originated in [[Notion]]. You're able to see them [here](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/) because I used [[Quartz Publishing]] to generate a static website, which is hosted through Vercel.

> [!info]- Expectations
> A note on expectations about the notes you'll find here:  **They are imperfect.**
> They aren't *meant* to be perfect.

Every note here *other* than this one was written with **me** as the expected audience. 

## Approaching These Notes
These notes use a slightly modified [[Slip-Box Method]]. They are meant to be [[Evergreen Notes]] and [[Atomic Notes]]. They are densely interconnected, and each relatively short. The best way to interact with them is to jump from link-to-link, use the graph view & backlinks (below), dive in on a particular tag, or the search bar. 

### Tags
Every note is associated with one or more of the following tags:  

In particular the tag *should* pull decently good starting points.

## About Me

I'm a guy trying to figure things out and live each day a little better than the last. I'm married with a couple of growing sons, living in a happy house here in Lawrence, KS.

![[GT9A8895_Gillespie_Original.jpeg]]
I'm an engineer by training. Coder by interest. Productivity nerd by habit. Quantified self believer by default. Maker by choice.
### My Other Stuff
* I have maintained a blog ("[The Column](https://aarongilly.com)") since 2012
* I have been doing quantified self stuff since 2014, recently rebuilt my system which is hosted [here](https://pdw.one), although [you probably shouldn't use it](https://aarongilly.com/pdw).
* I have been making puzzle boxes for my family to solve for the past few years, which have been living at [aaronspuzzles.com](https://aaronspuzzles.com)
