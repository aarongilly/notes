**A fairly bogus "step" of Your Money or Your Life's program.**

Included in the [[YMOYL 9 Step Program]] is this fairly bogus step: Watch for FI.

Basically, keep in mind that you might hit [[Financial Independence]] at some point and you should know when you do.

Monthly income = capital * current long-term interest rate/12 months
