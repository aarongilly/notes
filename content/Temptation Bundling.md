**Put something you want to do with something you have to do.**

**Temptation bundling** is a particular kind of [[Habit Stacking]] in which you pair a behavior which you find difficult, but you know is good for you (e.g. going to the gym) with a thing you enjoy (e.g. listening to an audiobook). 

## Examples

- Get a massage after going to the dentist
- A good & healthy post-workout smoothie
- Watch a movie while getting your oil changed
- Take your kid out to their favorite food place when you're going to the doctor
