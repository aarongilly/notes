**The most generic element of SysML. Can be have properties, behaviors, constraints, and many other features.**

The term “Block” is hard to define, but also fundamental to [[SysML]]. Blocks are the most generic form of Element that exists in SysML. `Block` is to SysML what `Object` is to JavaScript. Blocks can be extended ([[Standard SysML Block Extensions]] ), stereotyped, and reused. They can have all sorts of features, which are represented graphically via the use of **compartments**, **boundary ports**, or **links** to other elements.

Relationships between blocks are represented via [[Block Definition Diagram ]], whereas the internal workings of a single block are represented via [[Internal Block Diagram]].
