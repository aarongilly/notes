**Blaming others gives up your ability to control your life.**

If you want a better life, look first at every problem you have as being *your fault*. If you blame others for your problems, then you're implicitly saying there's nothing you can do about them. You are ceding power over your woes to other people. You're at their mercy and not in control of your life. The truth is, you **are** responsible.

Every problem in your life you are responsible for. **Even things that can't possibly be your fault (which is a smaller list of things than you probably think) you are *still* responsible for how you respond to those things.**

This gives you an internal [[Locus of Control]].
