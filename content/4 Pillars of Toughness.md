## Ditch the facade, embrace reality.
Know yourself. Embrace reality. 

## Your Body is Smart, Listen to It
Your feelings are telling you things. Get better at identifying and engaging with your emotions. Practice [[Interoception]].

## Respond, Don't React
Be [[Presence]]. Pay attention to your surroundings and your body. Consider your actions. 

## Transcend Discomfort 
Don't judge feelings, don't ignore feelings. Recognize them. Accept them. Don't judge or try to change them.
