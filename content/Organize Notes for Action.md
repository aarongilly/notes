**Works well as a filter for capturing, and maximizes usefulness to yourself in the future.**

Rather than trying to come up with a perfect hierarchy of organizational concepts for your notes, organize them forÂ **action**. Don't be overly rigid or prescriptive. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking:

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ How is this going to help me move forward in one of my current projects?

How can I make this as useful as possible to my future self?

When you focus on taking action the vast amount of information out there is radically streamlined and simplified. It also gives you a sense of tremendous clarity becauseÂ **you know everything you've kept has a purpose**
.
