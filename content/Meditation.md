**Meditation is for everyone and can help you live in the moment, understand how you work, and change reactions to responses.**

Meditation has a PR problem. You picture someone who meditates and your mind is cast to far-flung images of Monks in monasteries, or weird hippies who don't have jobs. Meditation is about training the brain ("get your mental reps in") to be present in the moment ([[Presence]]), how your body behaves given different situations & stimuli ([[R.A.I.N.]]), and how to go from reacting to what's happening in your life to responding to it. The truth is that Mediation is for everyone, and science is slowly discovering just how useful it can be.
