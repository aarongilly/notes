**Fusion and Fission of different atoms have different energy responses**

Basically, if an atom has a low atomic number, combing them (doing [[Nuclear Fusion]]) releases more energy than it takes. You're overcoming the strong force.
If an atom has a high atomic number, they have a lot of energy already stored inside them. Hitting them with a particle release more energy than it takes. You're overcoming the weak force.

Apparently Fe (iron) is the [[Critical Point]] in the fusion/fission curve, where Fusion begins *taking* energy and Fission begins *releasing* releasing energy.
