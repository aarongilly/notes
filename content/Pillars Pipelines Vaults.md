**August Bradley's version of Tiago Forte's PARA Method.**

The core of August Bradley's Notion-based "Life Operating System" is, what he calls Pillars, Pipelines, & Vaults. This closely mirrors Tiago Forte's [[PARA Method]].

## Pillars

Pillars are "things that hold the roof up". Roughly these seem to translate to `Areas` from PARA.

Pillars contain Goals.

### Example Pillars:

- Learning
- Family
- Health & Fitness
- Product Development
- Home

## Pipelines

These are the things you're working on. They're basically `Projects` from PARA. His Pipelines are more around workflows, though. He's got a "Projects" database that is linked to, but not the same as his Pipelines database.

## Vaults

These are the least well defined. They are very roughly translated over to the `Resources` part of PARA, but also the `Archives` part.

### Example Vaults

- Knowledge Management
- Media (Book reviews, podcast notes)
