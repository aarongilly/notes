**An olympic weightlifting technique lifting a bar from the floor up to the shoulders.**

High Pulls are an [[Olympic Weightlifting]] technique in which the lifter pulls a loaded barbell from the floor, up in front of the body, stopping at the level of the shoulders. High Pulls are essentially just partial [[Power Clean]]s. The difference between the two lifts is that with High Pulls the bar is not "caught" at the shoulders. The body never drops under the bar.
