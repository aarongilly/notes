**An online, block-based wiki/project management/notes super multitool app**

Notion is awesome. 

Awesome for:
- [[PKM]]
- [[Task Manager]] - it can be a good one
- Project Management
- [[Checklists]] and Templates

It's being copied by Microsoft. 

The closest thing to a Local version of Notion is probably [[Obsidian]].
