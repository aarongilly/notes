Quartz is an [[Open Source]] [[Static Site Generator]] built to publish [[Obsidian]] vaults to the web. It supports all the [[Obsidian Niceties]] out the box, including Obsidian-flavored [[Markdown]]. 

It's a [[TypeScript]] [[NodeJS]] project hosted [here in GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). It is what [[My Notes]] are published to the web using. That is very much a work in progress as of this writing. It does not support [[Excalidraw]] or [[DrawIO]] out the box, but does support [[Mermaid]] (like Obsidian itself). I was on the fence about using those tools to begin with, so this was the straw that broke the drawing tool's back.
