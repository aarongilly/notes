**If you want something to be successful, WHO is helping is more important than WHAT is being done**

Get the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus, before you start driving. Don’t outline your perfect vision before getting people on the bus, because often the ‘correct path’ will change. You need the people on the bus to be effective partners who will do the work, who want to do the work, and will make the work enjoyable no matter which direction the bus actually has to go.
