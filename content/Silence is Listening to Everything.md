**Silence isn't hearing nothing, it's listening to everything.**

Silence isn't hearing "nothing", it's listening to *everything*. If you're walking along, listening to music or whatever else in your headphones, you're not hearing nature. You're not hearing the city you're in, or the sounds of the park. You don't fully have [[Presence]].
