**TDEE is 2/3rds (or more) comprised of BMR.**

[[TDEE]] is Total Daily Energy Expenditure. BMR is Basal Metabolic Rate. TDEE is BMR + caloric cost of typical daily activity level.

[[BMR]] is *usually* about 2/3rds or more of TDEE, which means that we burn a **bunch** of calories just sustaining life. Even very active people typically don't get their TDEE more than 1.5x their BMR.
