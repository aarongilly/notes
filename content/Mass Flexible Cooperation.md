**Humans Rule because we are uniquely capable of flexible cooperation en mass.**

No other animals can cooperate in large numbers AND adapt to changing circumstances. 

Monkeys are flexible, but only in small numbers.

Bees work in large numbers, but are inflexible. 

Humanity rallies around the great [[Intersubjective Reality]], and that allows us to cooperate en masse. Gods. Corporations. Countries. Money.
