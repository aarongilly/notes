**Don’t listen so much to your experiencing self.**

Plan it in. Do it anyway.

> I’m tired now... but I’ll always be tired - and we draw energy from meaningful things. All time passes. Whether I do anything today or not, eventually I’ll be on the other side of the next 24 hours. It can be filled with nothing, in this case, meaningless somethings, or it can be filled with something more intriguing. As for that intriguing something, even if my anticipating self is more timid, eventually I’ll be on the other side of this activity. If it doesn’t kill me (and most things won’t) I’ll be left with a good story. I can push. And so I do.
