Obsidian's new "properties" feature makes it much more Notion-like. They show databases in their roadmap, perhaps soon they will be even more [[Notion]]-like.

To use Obsidian for Projects would probably be best-served by making heavy use of the [[Dataview Plug-in]] and calendar plug-in... as well as the formation of some sort of tagging scheme. 

It may be possible to patch some of the weak spots of an Obsidian as a [[Project Management App]] by adding the [[iOS Reminders App]] as a one-two punch. Get the contextual reminders and notifications there. Get Project notes and tasks here.
