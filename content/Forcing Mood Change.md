summary: Don't try to "overpower" the mood you're in. Redirect it like judo, or at least recognize the situation and your limits.

If you wake up in a bad mood, or a sad mood, you can't really [[Don't Force It|force results]] and simply "cheer up", as they say. Not recognizing this limitation and trying to willpower your way into a better, more positive, or more productive and energetic mood is a recipe for misery and trouble.

A better thing to do is to try these three, progressively easier tactics.
1. Change something about your situation such that mood change might actually happen. Use your body and breath to tap into your mind and spirit.
2. Redirect how you're feeling into some activity that would benefit from what you're naturally inclined to do right now.
	1. If you're too tired to be productive, watch that movie you've been meaning to get around to.
	2. If you're irritated, call up the business you need to haggle with to get your money back.
3. Accept it and take steps to minimize or contain the negativity. Find space. Mentally reframe what you think "should" be happening to bake your current mood into it. 

Taking some space to go exercise is all 3 of those things.
