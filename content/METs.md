**Metabolic Equivalents - a measure of physical exertion**

MET is a common measure used to express the energy expenditure and intensity of different physical activities. One Metabolic Equivalent (MET) corresponds with Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR). RMR is the total number of calories burned while your body is completely at rest. This is part of what your body needs to sustain itself while you’re awake. If the MET value of a specific activity is 4, it means that you’re burning 4 times as many calories as you would burn while resting.
