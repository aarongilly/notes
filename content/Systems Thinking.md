*Systems Thinking* is basically just a term coined to describe the act of taking the perspective that **the world is made of systems**, any given problem can be considered a *systems* problem.

This approach is *apparently* not common, or doesn't seem to come to some people as naturally as it lines up with my standard way of thinking. The more I read about "systems thinking" the more it seems to confirm that my typical way of thinking about things is through a systems lens.

Systems thinking is *useful* because common patterns/archetypes/principles show up in systems of all varieties. 

Example of a common pattern across domains:
- From **biology** - the more highly specialized a species is, the less likely it will adapt to a new environment
- From **computing** - the more well-optimized a software is to a certain kind of database, the less easy it will be to adapt to a new one
