**Energy Stored, in various forms**

Energy can be stored in all sorts of forms.

- **Gravitational Potential Energy** ([[Gravity Battery]]) - a heavy weight, high in the air.
- **Chemical potential energy** - what's in fossil fuels
- **Electrical potential energy** - a highly charged thing 
- **Mechanical potential energy** - super heavy flywheels, spinning very quickly in low-friction environments 
- **Elastic potential energy** - a stretched rubber band, not sure if this can be stored at scale
- **Nuclear potential energy** - energy stored in the nucleus of atoms, what's unleashed in Nuclear power
- **Thermal potential energy** - a hot object in a vacuum
