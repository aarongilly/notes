**Spewing all our shames before making a connection.**

One response to [[Vulnerability ]]  is to just, immediately bare all our shames. You see people to try do this to "fast-forward" a relationship. This doesn't work. It's not being vulnerable. It's using pseudo vulnerability as a defense mechanism ([[Vulnerability Shields]]). A sort of "here's everything before we actually get attached so that nothing comes out after we're attached that could hurt our attachment". It's not a good practice. 

The coin "Floodlighting" was coined by Brene Brown. She also referred to it as simply "oversharing". I like floodlighting better.
