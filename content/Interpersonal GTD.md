**G.T.D. focuses on the Individual, and the "things" that a person gets done should be aligned with their colleagues.**

Getting Things Done is a wonderful productivity philosophy, but it is not enough for a Knowledge Worker to truly produce work that is meaningful. Knowledge workers balance autonomy with collaboration. **GTD only works if you're the purveyor of your own domain, or if you've been correctly assigned the right "things" to get done.** Businesses routinely don't organize in the most effective ways. Individuals are overloaded or given conflicting things to get done, then he business doesn't make the progress it could be. Cal Newport suggests modeling your interpersonal business organization around discrete packets of work, something very akin to [[agile ]]Development in the software production realm.
