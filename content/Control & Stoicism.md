**Stoicism is all about knowing & accepting what you can and can't control.**

Stoicism is all about knowing what you can and can't control in the world around you.  You can't control events or other people. You can control how you respond to what happens to you and around you. Worry can hold your attention hostage. If you can't solve the problem, there's no use writing about it (the Dalai Lama said that).
