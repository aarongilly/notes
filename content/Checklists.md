**An under appreciated tool for doing things right every time while freeing you up to think about the hard stuff.**

Checklists are incredibly simple tools that donâ€™t get enough credit for what they do. They enable you to doing the basic, most fundamental but vital things correctly **every time** while freeing up your mind to think about the harder stuff. They reduce [[Noise]]. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ Checklists are not meant to be comprehensive how to guides. They are quick and simple checks to help skilled people who already know what they are doing.

See what makes [[A Good Checklist]]  

There are two basic approaches to checklists. See [[Read, Do or Do, Confirm]].

Checklists can be either to ensure the right things are done, or to ensure the right conversations are had. See [[Communications Checklist]]

Not all checklists are simple lists. See [[Other Forms of Checklist]] 

Checklists reduce errors of ineptitude. See [[Ineptitude and Ignorance ]].

## Other Reading

Checklists are the main topic of [[The Checklist Manifesto ]], essentially the main topic of [[Work the System]], and would fall into the â€˜Resourcesâ€™ part of the [[PARA Method]].
