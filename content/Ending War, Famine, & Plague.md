**Weâ€™re on the path to eradicating war, famine, and plague.**

Recently humanity turned a corner. More people alive today are likely to die from *overeating* instead of *under* *eating*. More people die from suicide than murder, terrorism, and war. More people die from non-infectious diseases than communicable ones. We are on the path to solving histories biggest problems:

- War
- Famine
- Plague
