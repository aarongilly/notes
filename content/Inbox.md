**An inbox is a collection point of things you need to do something about.**

An inbox (sometimes written as "In-box") is a collection point for tasks and things that will generate tasks. The purpose of the inbox itself is not to be well-organized, but to serve as a bounding box for those things which have not yet been organized. They are containers for the mess until it can be sorted through, which should be done on a frequent (daily or weekly at most) basis. 

[[Inbox Zero]] is getting to empty inbox.

Inboxes can be of multiple forms, and you may have many. If you have multiple, you may want to keep them listed in your [[Master List]] or incorporate them into some of your [[Periodic Reviews]].

## Example Inboxes

- Your email inbox
- Your task managers "inbox" or top-level
- A physical box on your desk
