**What habit prevents you from sliding into the abyss?**

[[The Broken Windows Theory]] of economics states that all broken windows should be fixed, and police should crack down on perpetrators of other such highly-visible signs of run down. **This same theory can apply to habits**. 

## Examples

1. You may need to make your bed, because an unmade bed seeds an unkempt room. 
2. The first dish in the sink is like a nucleus that pulls additional dishes inward.
