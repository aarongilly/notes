**Necessary, Yours, Mine, Optional - budgeting method for spouses/families**

A staple of the Budget Boot Camp course. A simple budgeting technique in which budgets categories are assigned by ownership.

**Necessary** - owned by nobody, things like mortgage, electricity, internet go here

**Yours** - the kinds of expenses typically managed by your spouse

**Mine** - the kinds of expenses you typically manage

**Optional** - anything not in the above

These tie into the [[7 Bank Accounts]] approach.
