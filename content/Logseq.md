**An [[Open Source]] competitor to Notion [[Notion]] and Obsidian [[Obsidian]]**

Logseq is an Open-Source competitor to [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]].

It is more of an **outliner** than Obsidian is. By default it shows outlines of bullets. Like Notion, it calls these "blocks". Also, like Roam Research it encourages your new notes to be added as part of daily pages.  It also has built-in task management features. [[Excalidraw]] is a slash command away at any given time. Nice.

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘Œ Logseq is better for transitory uses

Like Obsidian, it is built to work on local [[Markdown]] files. It has a benefit over Obsidian that this one is Open-Source. Therefore less susceptible to being nuked from the internet.

Like Obsidian, it supports proactive suggestions for *unlinked mentions* of notes. 

It would work very well as a [[Captainâ€™s Log]] for [[Ongoing Capture]]. It could be made to work as a [[Zettelkasten Components]].

Recently they introduced a [[Whiteboarding App]] feature. It's better than [[Obsidian Canvas]] at somethings, but worse at it for some others
## Drawbacks of Logseq
- It's not as fast as Obsidian
	- This is really the killer feature (in the ironic/literal sense of the phrase)
- The Markdown files it produces are less *clean* than Obsidian's
- Its built-in [[Task Manager]] clutters up the product from a purely-[[Slip-Box Method]] approach, it's less modular than Obsidian.
