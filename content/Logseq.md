**An open-source competitor to Notion [[Notion]] and Obsidian [[Obsidian]]**

Logseq is an Open-Source competitor to [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]].

It is more of an **outliner** than Obsidian is. By default it shows outlines of bullets. Also, like Roam Research it encourages your new notes to be added as part of daily pages.  It also has built-in task management features. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘Œ Logseq is better for transitory uses

Like Obsidian, it is built to work on local [[Markdown]] files. It has a benefit over Obsidian that this one is Open-Source. Therefore less susceptible to being nuked from the internet. 

Like Obsidian, it supports proactive suggestions for *unlinked mentions* of notes. 

It would work very well as a [[Captainâ€™s Log]] for [[Ongoing Capture]]. It could be made to work as a [[Zettelkasten Components]].
