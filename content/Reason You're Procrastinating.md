**To avoid discomfort of what you know is important, or because the thing doesn't seem important**

Procrastinating is essentially failing to start focusing. When it happens it's either because the thing you're procrastinating FROM seems too uncomfortable, or the thing you're procrastinating WITH seems more important. Try to recognize when you're procrastinating (aka not focusing on what you should be) and ask yourself which situation is causing it. 

If you're avoiding discomfort, a good strategy to get started is to [[Commit for a Bit]], because [[Action Relieves Anxiety]]. 

If you think your distraction is more important than the [[Know Your Immediate Task|Immediate Task]], then ask yourself if what you're doing achieves your goals, if the thing you're *not* doing really shouldn't be done at all, and if you need to come back later with a different energy.
