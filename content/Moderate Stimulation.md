**Too much stimulation causes you to not get things done.**

Novelty doesn’t require executive function to appreciate. It’s immediately rewarding in and of itself. Scrolling the internet not only sucks up your time, but makes time **not** spent doing it feel *worse*. Similarly, incredibly salty, high fat, high sugar foods saturate our tongues and our brains. These behaviors cause you to lack motivation for anything else in life (because [[Dopamine]] is the motivation chemical). 

If you’re finding yourself feeling lethargic and unmotivated, try doing a [[Dopamine Detox]].

Then again, all work and no play makes jack a dull boy. The key is [[Balance]].
