**Distance food was transported from being made to being eaten. Lower is better.**

Food Miles is a the distances food traveled between in its journey from generation to consumption. 

grown/slaughtered → prepared & packaged → consumed

The lower the number of average food miles of the food you eat, the lower the environmental impact of your eating.

From an energy perspective, the energy content of a grape doesn’t change depending on where it’s from and how far its come - but its net energy (it’s caloric energy minus its [[Embodied Energy]]) is very much affected.

It’s much more efficient to grow your own garden from seeds than it is to have all your food shipped in from farms afar.
