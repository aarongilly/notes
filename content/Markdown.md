**The lightweight styling markup language of GitHub, Reddit, StackExchange, Notion, and so many others.**

Markdown is a lightweight styling language. It allows you to style your text without taking your hands off the keyboard. It encodes the basic styles into the text, but does so in a way that keeps the text very readable, unlike other markup languages (looking at you, Hypertext Markup Language).

Itâ€™s de facto standard is [[CommonMark]]. 

## Examples from Memory

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3 (... up to 6 I think)
Regular line of text.

New paragraph, separated by a blank 
line from the text above.
