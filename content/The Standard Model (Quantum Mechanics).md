**Covers the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (not gravity) and classifies all known elementary particles.**

The Standard Model of physics covers the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (**not gravity**) and classifies all known elementary particles. It, along with general relativity (which covers gravity), are the two main models of physics.

It's actually just a formula:

No idea what any of that means.
## Fermions
The standard model is all about particles. There are 3 groups of 4 particles that make up *matter* - these 12 are **Fermions**, and they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This basically means they cannot occupy the same space at the same time.

| Normal Matter Ones | Heavier Ones        | Heaviest Ones       |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Electron           | Muon (200x heavier) | Tau (3500x heavier) |
| Up                 | Charm               | Top                 |
| Down               | Strange             | Bottom              |
| Neutrino           | Muon Neutrino       | Tau Neutrino        |
The "Normal Matter" ones are my wording. They make up everything around that you think of. 
- **Protons** are a combination of 2 "Up" quarks and 1 "Down"
- **Neutrons** are a combination of 1 "Up" quark and 2 "Down"
## Bosons
Alongside the 12 Fermions are 5 **Bosons**, which give rise to the 3 forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetism). They also include the Higgs Boson, which gives rise to mass - yet for some reason this doesn't make gravity part of the standard model? I don't get quantum physics. Sue me.

| Force            | Related Bosons    | Force Reference | Note                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Electromagnetism | Photon            | Chemistry       | Radiates Out                                                                   |
| Strong Force     | Gluon             | Fission         | Only happens *between* Fermions                                                |
| Weak Force       | W Boson & Z Boson | Fusion          | It's actually about **decay**. And its the **only** one that affects neutrinos |
|                  | Higgs Boson       | Mass            | Dunno why this doesn't mean *gravity* is in the Standard Model.                |
