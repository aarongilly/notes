**Capitalism is investing profits into capital, to generate more profits.**

Capitalism is the belief in the ever-growing pie. You get a bigger slice not by taking from others, but by growing the pie for everyone.

> [!tldr] ⛵ Capitalism says a rising tide raises all boats

Capitalism is the repeated process of investing profits from a venture into capital which serves to return more profits in the future. It's a loop. 

## Put Simply

Exiting Capital → Exiting Profits → More Capital → More Profits → Even More Capital → Even More Profits
