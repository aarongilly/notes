It seems as though meetings can generally be categorized into **one** of the following types:

- **Stucture-Keeping** - standups, other types of recurring meetings that provide a standard time to hook in communication tasks and/or other things that need to be done on a cadence.
	- Features: standard (agenda, standard attendees, typically shorter duration 
	- Goal: stick to the agenda, do what’s necessary and not more
- **Presentational** - one person or group needs to brief others about a specific thing.
	- Features: visuals, one-sided, Q&A, short-to-medium duration
	- Goal: “so what” communication understood by audience
- **Working** - a collaborating teaming session working at a particular problem or a particular artifact together.
	- Features: problem-orientation, small size, longer duration
	- Goal: the discrete deliverable, with inputs from all

Each type of meeting would have different best practices. A different type of agenda. Different supporting tools (eg a whiteboard).

I think “*this could have been an email*” syndrome occurs more often when the meeting *type* is unclear, the meeting tried to mix types, or the wrong approach was taken for the type.
