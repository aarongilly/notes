**A focus on long-term purpose & evaluate all actions against their ability to move you toward it.**

> [!success] Toyota's Management Principle:
> Base your management principles on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals

Find a sense of purpose, superseding any short-term deliverable. Your purpose is not to make money, it is to enable yourself to provide value indefinitely. Align your actions to achieving this purpose. Evaluate every process for its ability to generate meaningful value to the customer, the people, and the economy. Strive to decide your own fate. Hone those skills that enable you to produce these types of value.

Blue Origin's motto is *“Gradatim Ferociter”,* which is Latin for “Step by Step, Ferociously.”
