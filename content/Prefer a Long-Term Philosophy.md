# Long-Term Philosophy

Toyota's Management Principle #1

### Base your management principles on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals

Find a sense of purpose, superseding any short-term deliverable. Your purpose is not to make money, it is to enable yourself to provide value indefinitely. Align your actions to achieving this purpose. Evaluate every process for its ability to generate meaningful value to the customer, the people, and the economy. Strive to decide your own fate. Hone those skills that enable you to produce these types of value.

This is very much in line also with James Clear's philosophies (doing small things right compounds over time) and the 25 Year Vision document from The Antifragile Planning Method. This is also Jeff Bezos's preferred method to accomplish big things. His space company "Blue Origin" has this logo:

Blue Origin's motto is *“Gradatim Ferociter”,* which is Latin for “Step by Step, Ferociously.”
