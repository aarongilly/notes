**After-Tax Advantages Savings Account, most flexible tax-advantaged account type.**

Roth IRAs are like [[Traditional IRAs]], except that they allow you to withdrawal any contributions you’ve made at any time without penalty. **These accounts are the most flexible** for that reason. You also don’t ever run into a “force distributions” age. Note you still have to be 59 1/2 to withdrawal both your contributions **and**
 the growth.

[[529 Accounts]] have a similar behavior, but are for education - not retirement.
