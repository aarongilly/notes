**Hobbies expand your horizons and bring meaning.**

## Hobbies are Good

Leisure is freedom from the activities that are needed to merely survive. Hobbies are leisure work. They expand your horizons and enable you to do more and be more. Engage in pursuits that simultaneously engage and relax you. Expand your knowledge and capacities in entirely different contexts. Have humility. Be okay with being bad at the beginning, because you are a beginner. Trust in the process. See: [[Right Process â‡’ Right Results]].
