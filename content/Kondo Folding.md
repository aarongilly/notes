**Marie Kondo wants everything folded into rectangles & stored on edge.**

The basic tenet of Kondo Folding is to get things into a rectangular shape, such that they are the same height as the depth of whatever drawer you're storing them in. Then you put them in the drawer **on their edge** to make everything visible at once, and maximize used space.
