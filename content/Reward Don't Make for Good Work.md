**Work that's performed for a reward is often worse than work that was done for fun.**

Don't use extrinsic motivation. It's fleeting and it makes you disinterested in the THING you actually are doing. People who perform a task for a reward tend to do a much worse job at applying their creative brain. They produce inferior results and have a worse time while doing it.

Criticism doesn't touch the man who performs only for his own purposes. If you're doing something truly for yourself, then it genuinely doesn't matter what others think of it.

**[[Intrinsic Motivation]] >> Rewards**. It leads to [[Flow]].
