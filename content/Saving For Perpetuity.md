summary: That which warrants saving, that which does not.

If everything is a [[Priorities|priority]] then nothing is. Not everything should be saved forever. In fact, probably >80% to 99% of most stuff you do, make, or interact with isn't worth saving in *at all*.

That which I believe is worth saving:

- ~1 out of every 10 photos
- Data associated with a metric you're tracking
- Things you create that are good
- Permanent notes like these
- Taxes, for 7 years
- Stuff you did that you know you'll have to do again.
