**Proprioception** is your sense of the body's position in space. It is largely a subconscious phenomenon, but can be called to mind. It is about your joint angles and extensions. It is what enables physical procedural memory to occur. It can be used alongside gestures to think in better, more abstract ways. You pick up new subjects (such as language learning) while using gestures, perhaps because this brings into the learning game your [[Adaptive Unconscious]] and shared the cognitive load between your [[Central Executive]] and your proprioceptive systems in your unconscious.
