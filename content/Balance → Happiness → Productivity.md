**Working too much makes you unhappy, unhappy people are less productive.**

The most productive people work no more than 40 hours. The most productive people take ample time for rest, relaxation, and pleasure. Working constantly puts your mind through a blender. You’re your most creative, best self when you’re happy. Beyond that, the point of life isn’t to work all the time. It’s to be happy. It just so happens that being happy also means you’re libel to also do you’re best work.

Follow your natural rhythms. Don't push through needed [[Breaks [[index)]]]]. Make the most of them.
