**Organization is intentional allocation of spacetime**

## Source


Organization is the intentional allocation of spacetime. Not just space. Not just time. Both, working together.

If you have a dedicated space for a thing, then it is organized. If you have a dedicated space for a class of things, then you are capable of organizing all things of that class. 

More than just physical real-estate, a well organized individual has made space in their calendar for everything. Marie Kondo your drawers, then take a look at your calendar. You keep certain physical things in certain drawers so you know where they are when you consider them, you should keep certain temporal things in places on your calendar so that you know they will be considered at all.

**The secret is having both - a dedicated space for your stuff, *and* a dedicated time to deal with it.**
