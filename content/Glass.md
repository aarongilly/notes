**A vital substance to our development as a civilization**

Glass is silicon dioxide. It formed naturally out in a desert somehow long ago. It was found in King Tut’s tomb. Glass begets (or at least, enables) this series of events:

1. Glass is beautiful → glass is valuable
2. Glass is valuable → Glassmaking becomes popular
3. Glassmaking is dangerous → glassmakers are concentrated together
4. Glassmaker concentration → glass innovations
5. Glass innovations → clearer glass
6. (unrelated: Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press is invented) → people realize they’re all far-sighted
7. People have reason to correct far-sightedness + glass innovations → glasses are invented
8. Glasses are invented → Microscopes & telescopes are invented
9. Microscopes and telescopes increase human capacity for knowledge acquisition → further human understanding of sciences
10. Glass + Metallurgy → mirrors are invented
11. Mirrors become popular → people develop a sense of self unlike they had before
12. Mirrors enable the invention of “perspective” art

— glass as a tool —

1. Glass strands are found to be incredibly strong → fiberglass is created
2. Ultra-clear glass + glass strands → Fiber-optic cables are possible & transcontinental internet is possible
