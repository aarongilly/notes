**Satisficing is a mental shortcut where we settle for a “good enough” choice rather than tax the mind for unimportant choices.**

“**Satisficing**” - settling for “good enough” for the unimportant things. Not wasting time looking for the “perfect” pen. Or spend a loooong time looking for shampoos. Satisficing is finding an easy, good enough solution for things that don’t affect us much. It’s a Mental shortcut & a good thing. It frees the mind from [[Decision Fatigue]] and leaves more energy for more essential thoughts & tasks.
