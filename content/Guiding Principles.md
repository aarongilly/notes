Like everything relating to "principles", the definitions here are somewhat squishy. There exists a class of principles that feel more "concrete" and unambiguous than the more generic "do good things"-type principles. 

[[Make the Decision that Informs all Subsequent Decisions]].

I haven't figured out how to really describe these, but here are some examples that come to mind, in particular [Obsidian's Manifesto](https://obsidian.md/about) comes to mind.

## Examples
### Zero Waste
Don't do any activity that produces wasted material.

### Obsidian's Manifesto
You should [go read it](https://obsidian.md/about), it's the best example I can think of.
- The dedication to durable, open file formats.
- Your data live on your device, and End-to-end encrypted if going to the server.
- Adaptable, that the tool should be as modular as possible and not "force" features on users.
- Obsidian is supported by users, not investors.
