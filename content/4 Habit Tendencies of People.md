# The 4 Tendencies

The four tendencies fall into a punnet square pattern about their tendency to uphold or shirk expectations of outer and inner origins. 

1. Questioner - no outer, yes inner
2. Upholders - yes outer, yes inner
3. Rebels - no outer, no inner
4. Obliger - yea outer, no inner

These are basically in-born and unchanging tendencies.
