**Being sedentary is not a good thing in high doses.**

The modern man is enabled by an abundance of tools and resources to sustain ourselves while remaining wholly inactive than any of our ancestors. Chronic inactivity is a byproduct of refrigerators full of food, house walls keeping away pests and predators, desk jobs, and take-out. It is *also* the cause of (or, at least, a major contributor to) many of the diseases that plague our modern post-industrialized society. Lack of exercise (or even lower forms of 'simple activity', like folding clothes) is a contributing factor to [[Chronic Low-Level Inflammation]].
