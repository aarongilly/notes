**Jeff Bezos's philosophy for succeeding in business.**

Jeff Bezos, who may or may not be the richest person in the world right now depending on what day it is, has a simple philosophy that he credits with Amazon's many successes: Day 1.

> “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.” - Jeff Bezos
> 

Day 1 is about keeping your customers as the #1 priority, keeping an eye on what others are doing to learn to adopt and adapt, keeping a skeptical view of [[Proxy Measures]], and partaking in high-velocity [[Decision Making]].

The view of Proxy measures is that they are a trap that causes businesses to manage against metrics and not actual results. (See also: [[Gaming KPIs]]). Jeff Bezos talked about focusing on the process and not the results being a **bad** thing, which is antithetical to much of the other stuff I've read. 

Embrace trends you see in others. Being too stuck in your ways is a sure fire way to use momentum. If everyone else is doing it, your probably should be too.
