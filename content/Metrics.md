**How you're measuring the health or success of a thing.**

Metrics are how you measure the health or success of a thing. You can have metrics for enduring [[Defining Area|area]]s, or time-bound [[Defining Project|project]]s. 

Standard Project metrics include:
- Schedule
- Budget 
- [[OKRs]]

Area metrics depend on the particulars of the area. Metrics for areas are typically called [[KPIs]]. Some lend themselves better to metrics than others. Some examples might be:
- Easy to Measure Area: _Health_. 
  Metrics: Sick days taken. For-purpose doctor's visits. Self-reported health scores. Quantity/frequency of painkillers or similar medications.
- Difficult to Measure Area: _Relationship_. 
  Metrics: frequency/intensity of disagreements, frequency of proper dates
