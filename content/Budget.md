**The first step in mastering finances.**

Having a budget is literally the first step in mastering your finances. Without a budget you're flying in the dark. Budgets tell you where your money is going (and the size of your [[Burn Rate]]), where your money will go*, and how big your [[Emergency Fund]] needs to be.

Your budget should include:

- How much money are you making?
    - From where?
- How much money are you spending?
    - To where?
    - On what?

Typically budgeting practices utilize budget ‘Categories’. There’s no ‘one way’ to implement a budget or to build your categories. Apps like Mint have dozens (if not 100+) categories pre-built. On the opposite end of the spectrum is a budgeted method like what’s recommended in the [[Budget Boot Camp]] [[NYMO]] method, which uses 4 categories.
