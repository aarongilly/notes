**Balance work on production with work on the ability to produce.**

# Definitions

### P

The production of valuable output.

### PC

The production capability of a given machine, person, or system.

# Balance

The key to long term levels of production is balancing the efforts spent to produce (P) with the efforts spent to maintain or improve the capability to produce (PC). 

If you never run, you die early. If you run 10 miles a day, you add 10 years onto your life, but you spend all of your time running.

Balance is key.
