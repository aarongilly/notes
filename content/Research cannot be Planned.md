**Unlike project management, the results of research cannot be planned ahead.**

Unlike project management - learning and research is not linear. You cannot plan ahead how you’re going to see the results of your learning. 

Mapping out how you plan to learn all about a new topic is not wise. You’ll learn something, then reassess what you know now and what the next topic should be. In the end, you may get to where you’re going via an entirely different route — or you may very well likely decide where you thought you were going wasn’t where you wanted to go after all.
