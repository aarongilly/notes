**`= this.summary`**

1. Be consistent in most things.
	1. Perform structured periodic reviews and maintain inbox zero.
2. Bias toward action. Fail fast. Learn fast. Don't guess at results. Observe them.
3. Help your future self. Make things as easy for him as possible.
4. Build on yourself. Don't start from scratch if you can avoid it.
	1. Look for how problems were solved in the past. Don't reinvent the wheel.
5. **Focus**. Do one thing at a time until it's finished.
6. Figure out what's important, and pay attention to it.
	1. Fun is important, enable fun whenever possible.
7. Do the simpler thing. Eliminate what's unnecessary before adding something new.
8. Don't skip workouts, don't skip reps, don't compromise form.

This list is not meant to be exhaustive. It's meant to be shortened to those that resonate the strongest.
