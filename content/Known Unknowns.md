**An intermediary component of the known/unknown matrix.**

The bottom-left quadrant of the [[Known Unknown Matrix]] is the Known Unknowns section. These are questions or dependencies which you’re aware of, but don’t yet know the answers to. They are the reason most people will think to use a buffer when planning. They are not, however, the worst things that can happen. That’s the realm of the [[Unknown Unknowns]].
