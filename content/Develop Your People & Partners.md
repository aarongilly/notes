# Toyota's Principles 9 - 11

### Grow leaders who understand the work, buy into the philosophy, and teach it to others

Seek leaders first from within. They are not those with the best people skills who accomplish tasks at hand, they are those who understand the work and the philosophy.

### Develop exceptional people and teams who follow the company's philosophy

Drive company values consistently. Utilize cross-functional teams to solve difficult problems. Teach teamwork, and depend on it for your success.

### Respect your extended network of people and partners by challenging them and helping them improve

Respect your partners and suppliers as though they were a part of your business (because they are). Give the appropriately challenging deliverables, then assist them in achieving them.
