**Budgets are like diets, doomed to fail long-term**

Budgeting is like dieting. Subject to the same failure mechanisms. It’s imposing controls from the outside in. It’s better to go from the inside out. Just be conscious of when you’re eating (spending money) and why. Observe your internal desires. Don’t do crash budgeting, change a little bit over the long haul by being conscious of the fulfillment you’re seeking.

It's better to make a lifestyle-change than to insert any sort of "sprint". You're more successful with less strict budgets/diets that can be sustained over great time periods, rather than strict ones that are due to fail. Consider [[Minimum Viable Progress]] and [[Prefer a Long-Term Philosophy]].
