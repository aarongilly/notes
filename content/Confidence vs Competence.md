**They don't necessarily follow one-another**

You think they'd follow each other. But often they don't. Armchair quarterbacks are high confidence, low competence. Imposter Syndrome describes high competence low confidence. 

A lack of competence due to a lack of exposure (or simply the [[Mere Exposure Effect]]) will sometimes result in falsely high confidence. This is what the [[Duning-Kruger Effect]] is all about.

Confidence can be earned through exposure, perhaps through the use of [[Drilling Cycles|drilling]] and [[Deliberate Practice]]. These things work because [[Raising the Floor is as Valid as Raising the Ceiling]].
