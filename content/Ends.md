**Endings have more importance to behavior & recollection.**

At the end of a decade, you're more likely to run a marathon, kill yourself, cheat on your spouse. NFL games are most likely to see scoring plays in the last minute of the first half... with another spike in the last minute of the game.

People have a bias toward remembering the end of an event. We tend to remember people based on the last things they did. 

In an experiment where students were given a series of five chocolates, then asked to pick their favorites. If a student was not told how many chocolates there would be, and were not warned about the lack of future samples, their selections were relatively evenly distributed, with the last chocolate being chosen as the favorite 22% of the time. However, if a student was told before eating their last chocolate "this is the last one", they tended to enjoy it more, enjoy the overall experience more, and select *that* chocolate as their favorite... 63% of the time.
