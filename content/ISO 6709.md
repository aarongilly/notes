**The "official" way to store & transmit geographic coordinates. Less well-supported than ISO 8601.**

ISO 6709 is the "official" way to textually represent geographic coordinates, as identified by the International Organization for Standards. It represents latitude, longitude, and altitude. Unlike its cousin standard [[ISO 8601]], 6709 is not widely utilized by various programming languages.

It goes vertical coordinate (y), then horizontal coordinate (x), then altitude/depth. Positive numbers mean northern hemisphere, east of the Prime Meridian, and above sea level, respectively. Negative numbers are the opposite. Once altitude/depth are involved, things get complex. You need a reference point, of which there are a few registries (such as "WGS_84" (used by [[GPS]], probably the most common)).

There are a few ways to do Lat/Long/Alt.
- Using Degrees, Minutes, & Seconds:
    - 50°40′46.461″N 95°48′26.533″W
- Using Degrees & decimal places:
    - +50.679573, -95.807370/
- Including Altitude
    - +27.5916+086.5640+8850CRSWGS_84/

It appears as though the "CRSWGS_84" bit is implied in real-world applications I was able to find. For example - from the W3C wiki:

```
Mount Everest     +27.5916+086.5640+8850/
South Pole        -90+000+2800/
New York City     +40.75-074.00/ 
```
