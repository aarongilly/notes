**The only time you should reinvent the wheel is when you're 100% sure that's what you want to do.**

# Don't Reinvent the Wheel

Most problems that you encounter when trying to do simple things have already been solved. Don't waste your time approaching your ends by trying to find a new means.

Make a habit of looking for & utilizing pre-existing best practices. Even if they are [[Unsexy Solutions]]. 

# Exception

Reinvent something if the reinvention is **explicitly** what you set out to do. Some things just suck. But in the path of fixing them, you shouldn’t be reinventing every step along the way.

> [!tldr] ➡️ The only time you should reinvent the wheel is when you’re 100% sure that’s what you want to do.

## Coding

Use libraries.

## Business

Look at the tools already in-use before building a new one.

## Problem-Solving

Try Googling some keywords describing the problem you're having.
