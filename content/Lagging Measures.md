**A measure of a situation that is only available after an event has occurred. Opposite of leading measure.**

[[Leading measures]] are signs indicating something has happened. While they have the disadvantage of not giving you information about an event until after it occurs, they are necessary where [[Leading Measures]] cannot be taken.

Lagging Measures are the opposite of [[Leading Measures]], both of which often are [[Proxy Measures]]. Both of which may be tracked by an agent as [[KPIs]].

## Example Lagging Measures

- Test results as a lagging measure of a student's effort.
- Subscribers lost as a lagging measure of content quality.
