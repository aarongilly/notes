**Doing something that hurts everyone to limit the amount you're hurt.**

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a thought experiment wherein two people who've committed a crime are brought into separate interrogation rooms and given a choice wherein they can incriminate their old partner, giving that person a longer sentence, or shorten the severity of their own punishment.

Outcomes:

If `A rats on B` and `B rats on A` then

they are both given 2 years of prison.

If `A rats on B` and `B does not incriminate A` then

`A` walks free

`B` goes to prison for 3 years

If `A does not incriminate B` and `B rats on A` then

`A` goes to prison for 3 years

`B` walks free

If `A does not incriminate B` and `B does not incriminate A` then

they both walk free

In the dilemma, a **rational self-interested agent** would increment their partner. It gives them the least punishment, even if it guarantees that their partner ends up in jail for at least 1 year.

This has all sorts of real-world practical implications, particularly in a military sense. See related notes.
