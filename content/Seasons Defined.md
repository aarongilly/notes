**There's *Meteorological* Seasons that align with months and *astronomical* seasons that align with equinoxes and solstices**

The beginning of a new season is actually somewhat vague. It depends on what you decide to be the defining factor in the delineation between them. Do you go based on months (/temperature cycles), or do you go based on solstices and equinoxes (/length of days)?
