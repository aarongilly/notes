**A state of being 'on top of it all'.**

Inbox Zero is a state in which your [[Inbox]] is free from [[Open Loops]]. Reaching this state should be the goal of a [[Weekly Review]] (if not even a [[Daily Review]]). To be at inbox zero, you have to have gone through all of the junk that accumulates and dealt with it - either by doing it ([[2 Minute Rule of GTD]]), scheduling it ([[Contextual Reminders]]), or organizing it into [[Project Lists]].
