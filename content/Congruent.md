**A geometric term, meaning same shape & size, denoted with a `≡`**

When applied to **angles**, angles are congruent when they are the same. This involves [[Modular Arithmetic]].
- 10 degrees is congruent to 370 degrees, or: `10° ≡ 370°`

When applied to **sides** they are only congruent if they are the same length.

When applied to a **shape**, shapes are congruent if they are the same shape and size, translations and rotations are okay, though.
