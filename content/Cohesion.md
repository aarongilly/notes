# alias: cohesive

**The degree to which different elements inside a module "belong" together.**

Cohesion is something that happens inside a system component. Unlike [[Coupling]], cohesion is **intra-component**.

Sometimes it is hard to determine where to draw the line between adding a feature to an existing system component or adding a new component to the system to encapsulate a feature. 

In general, **high-cohesion is good**.

### Example of High-cohesion
- A hammer - the [[More is Unnecessary, Less is Impossible.|Perfect Tool]]

### Example of Low-cohesion
- Microsoft Word dumping a ton of features in about mail merge
