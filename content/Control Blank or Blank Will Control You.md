A surprisingly common turn of phrase that I have come across in my reading is: 

> [!quote] Control your (blank) or your (blank) will control you

Where that blank is filled with:
- Environment - (Willpower Doesn’t Work)
- Computer - ([[The Things We Make]])
- Calendar - ([[Off the Clock]] and/or [[Deep Work (book)]])
- Projects - ([[Building a Second Brain]])

Although I don’t specifically ever seeing these in this context, I feel like several books I’ve read could be summarized in this way:
- Control your money or your money will control you
- Control the things you buy or the things you buy will control you
