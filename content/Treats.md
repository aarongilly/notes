**Treats are good. When they stop being good, they should be stopped.**

# Treats

Treats are good. They bring joy and meaning to life. Pay attention to little pleasures. But don’t let them become too routine. Don’t let the treat become part of the background. As soon as you stop appreciating the treat, you should stop treating yourself to it. 

It's probably better, though, to cultivate treats that don't harm you over the long-term (e.g. black coffee rather than energy drinks).
