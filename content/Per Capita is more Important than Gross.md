**Per capita ROI is better than large gross totals.**

Total dollars matters much less than dollars per hour. Maximizing value per time is *the* stated goal. Settling for a schedule completely full of 60% good work means you'll be constantly busy, and making 40% less than you could be making elsewhere â€”- or that you're using 40% more of your life than you'd need to accomplish the same results elsewhere.

If you're making a salary of $100k a year, but you're working 70 hours a week, you're making less than someone who works 40 hours a week for $70k. Value your time & energy. They are you. Value yourself.
