**Per capita ROI is better than large gross totals.**

Total dollars matters much less than dollars per hour. Maximizing value per time is *the* stated goal. Settling for a schedule completely full of 60% good work means you'll be constantly busy, and making 40% less than you could be making elsewhere — or that you're using 40% more of your life than you'd need to accomplish the same results elsewhere.

> [!NOTE] Value In ➡️ Value Out

If you're making a salary of $100k a year, but you're working 70 hours a week, you're making less than someone who works 40 hours a week for $70k. Value your time & energy. They are you. Value yourself. It's your [[Life Energy]].

Other applications:
- Modeling the heck out of an [[Enterprise Architecture]] may yield and incredibly robust multidimensional network of interlinking views... but may take 100s to 1000s of person-hours, whereas simple [[Core EA Diagrams]] may yield 80% of the effective value using way less than 20% of the work.
