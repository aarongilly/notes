**Mindfulness is living in the now, not the past or future.**

"Mindfulness" is the common modern term applied to the practice of experiencing here and now. Those who aren't *mindful* may very well spend an entire day alternatively ruminating about the past and planning for the future, never appreciating what they are experiencing in the moment. 

In the book "[[How to Do Nothing]]" this concept is pitched as quite literally 'doing nothing', which is what enables you to ground sense the concrete world around you wherever you are.
