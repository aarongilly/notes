"Foundation for Execution" is a phrase from [[Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy]] that essentially refers to the capabilities to execute the little things *(from a business perspective)* **well** and without need for thought. This is achieved through **digital systems that enable employees executing routine processes to do so reliably, repeatably, and without trouble**. This is the foundation on which the business grows. It's enabled by [[Enterprise Architecture]]. See [[UPS Example Foundation for Execution]].

This relies on [[Qualities of Good Data]]. It relies on good and obvious business processes supported by [[Paved Roads]]. Like those that would function like a [[Pit of Success]].

This is the "[[Routine Frees the Mind]]" equivalent for businesses. You can't make effective changes to your swim gear if you're spending all your time fighting for air. 

> [!success] Good Foundations
> Good Foundations for Execution are the result of IT capabilities that are well-aligned to business objectives. This means the objectives themselves must be clear.
 
## Warning Signs
If you've got a bad foundation for execution you might tick these boxes:

- [ ] Different parts of the business would give different answers using different techniques to the same questions
- [ ] IT is a bottleneck & everyone knows it
- [ ] There are different ways to do the same types of fundamental things, depending on where you are
- [ ] Information needed to make decisions is not readily available, it needs mined and transformed
- [ ] There is no process to handle changes, each new initiative feels like "starting from scratch"

## Ask Yourself
- What processes are digitized end-to-end? Are they mission-critical?
- What data are easily accessible to your employees & customers? Is this the data they need to make decisions?
- What strengths and weaknesses do you see in your foundation?
