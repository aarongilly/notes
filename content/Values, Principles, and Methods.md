**Increasingly concrete**

It's good to know your values. Your principles make them actionable (because [[Principles are Verbs]]), and enumerating methods make them concrete. A good thing to think of as a group/hierarchically.  

Sort of a "why", "what", and "how" trio... sort of. 
### Examples

| Value | Principle | Methods |
| :-: | :-- | -- |
| Charity | Give what you can to those who need it more |  I will donate 25% of my bonuses and volunteer one day per quarter at XYZ shelter |
| Simplicity |  Do the simplest thing | I will favor plans with the fewest moving parts. I won't reinvent the wheel. I will apply the [[Pareto Principle]] rather than do it all. |
