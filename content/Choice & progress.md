**It is worse to be making a millimeter of progress in a million directions than to make great progress in a few.**

Trying to keep everyone happy is a recipe for keeping everyone *not mad,* but also not really *happy.* Placing equal bets on all horses is a fools errand. Juggling balls feels worse than making a focused effort on something. You might succeed at not to fail at anything, but in doing so you’re ensuring you’ll never truly succeed at anything either.
