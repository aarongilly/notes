**A local, folder-based Personal Knowledge Management application using durable data structures. This application here!**

Obsidian is a note taking & personal knowledge management ([[PKM]]) application that utilizes a folder-based, plaintext backend that lives on your computer. It uses [[Durable File Types]] and allows for no cloud-dependencies, and is therefore (theoretically) your “final destination” for PKM. There are other [[Obsidian Use Cases]], but you've not (yet) made those work.

It’s goal is to give you a **permanent, durable** home for your body of notes. It’s a competitor to [[Notion]] in some ways - and will be what these notes are housed in eventually. It utilizes [[Markdown]] and [[YAML]], and lets you embed local files into your notes. It’s got a robust plugin system and is incredibly highly configurable and modular. The aim is to keep it as lean as possible while giving you the tools to do anything. 

It has built-in support for [[Mermaid]], and a great [[Excalidraw]] plug-in. 

It has over 1000 plug-ins, including the incredible [[Dataview Plug-in]] (which should become a standard part of Obsidian, really). Although I decided to [[Only Use Obsidian Plug-ins That Retain Portability]].
