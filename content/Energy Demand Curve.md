**Household Energy Demand is nowhere near ‘constant’**

Power consumption demand raises and falls dramatically throughout the day. Power plants have to deal with peaks and troughs. In order to handle the peaks, they must build a large and robust grid. That grid is the mostly unnecessary for the trough times. It’s like highway design. We build 5 lane highways for rush hour, but most of the time most of those 5 lanes are empty. If we could shift around rush hour we could get something that was used consistently.

Our ‘peak power’ timeframe from Evergy is considered to be 2 to 7pm on weekdays.
