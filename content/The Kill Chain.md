**Understand > Decide > Act**

The kill chain is a term used by members of the militia and Department of Defense to refer to the sequence of:

1. Understand the situation
2. Decide what you want to do
3. Act in a way that achieves the desire effect

Note: this is the definition used in the book, but not perfectly aligned with what I find elsewhere. Elsewhere it has more steps, or is more cyber-attack focused. Loosely they fit the concept.
