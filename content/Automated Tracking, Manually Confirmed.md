**The best approach to keeping track of stuff well.**

The most success I've had with tracking stuff is when new entries were made by way of some sort of automation AND there was some sort of manual confirmation (or revision) of the automated entries during a standard review process. Copying the data from a read-only, automated source (e.g. Apples Health app) and changing what needs changed enables a [[Single Source of Truth]].

Automation without review leads to incorrect data confounding your tracking.

Manual-only tracking is more likely to result in missed data.
