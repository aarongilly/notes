An argument could be made to say the most important app that Apple ever created is their Health App.

Apple's Health app is an absolute treasure trove of good, useful, insightful data. Combining it with an Apple Watch (and other sensors, such as my Oura Ring) make its capability crazy good. 

Its only limitation from a quantified-self enthusiast's perspective is its lack of (good) mechanisms to "correct" data. While you absolutely *can* manually add data, it's less easy to manually *correct* inaccurate data... and it's on you to find these inaccuracies. [[Automated Tracking, Manually Confirmed]] is my gold standard, and the app only really excels at one of the two. 

It natively supports tracking:
- [[Sleep Duration]] and some portions of your [[Sleep Hygiene]]
- Duration & type of Exercise
	- Running/biking/swimming speed, cadence, distance, etc
- Steps, sedentary time, and the standard pedometer stuff
	- Including [[METs]], which I didn't know about
- Body measurements (Weight, height, etc)
- [[Macronutrient Calories|Macros & Calories]]
- Medications
- Mental wellbeing
- Respiratory info
	- Rate
	- O2 level
	- [[VO2 Max]] & Cardiovascular fitness
