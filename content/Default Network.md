**Our daydreaming state, aka boredom, that we all default to given nothing on which to [[focus]].**

Your brain slips into the default mode when you’re bored or day dreaming. It skips from thing to thing via relations you’ve formed in your head. **In doing so it makes those connections stronger.** This is called “the default network” and it a relatively new discovery. It is not centralized to any spot in the brain. It’s a circuit.

> [!tldr] 👌 Daydreaming helps build connections between concepts in the brain.

It’s one of the four components of the [[Human Attentional System]] - opposed to the [[Central Executive]]
