**There's no "Official" tool, but there are many capable ones**

There's no "Official" tool for making IDEF0 diagrams. Perhaps because they are so rudimentary that such a tool couldn't possibly have a giant competitive advantage over one-another, but perhaps more likely just that there isn't really a huge demand, despite the fact that [[IDEF0]] is "the most useful tool" to communicate business change, according to the author of Business Process Re-engineering using IDEF0. While there are multitude of tools and platforms trying to be "the platform" for [[SysML]], [[UML]], and even [[Archimate]], the best tools for [[IDEF]] are general-purpose in nature. 

This means there's no guarantee of [[Referential Integrity]] enforced by the tooling. This is something that, frankly, I **could** build myself *someday*™️.

## Tools
- **Pen & Paper**- it's what the language was designed with, and it works well!
- **[[Excalidraw]]** - my favorite white boarding app is great, perhaps the best, for making single diagrams. It's not great for multi-page "drillable" diagrams, though.
- **[[DrawIO]]** - is good for multi-page diagramming and looks to have everything else!
