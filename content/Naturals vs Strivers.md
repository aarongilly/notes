**Strivers make better teammates & partners.**

We love naturals. Intuitively, we tend to prefer the person for whom achievement seems to come without effort. This isn't necessarily what we *think* is correct intellectually - but evidence suggests our gut wants to go with those who seem like they achieve without exertion. Strivers have grit. They are more likely to stick with you through whatever setbacks you may encounter. 

Be aware of this bias, and that it might lead to suboptimal choices when picking out partners, teammates, or other such things.
