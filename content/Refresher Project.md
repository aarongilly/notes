**A project timed to exercise mental muscles you haven't used in a while**

One form of [[Spaced Repetition]] is the idea of the refresher project. Maybe it's been a while since you've coded in Python, so you find an excuse to make something using Python. Or you find an excuse to draw winning because you haven't done sketches in a long time. It's a way to preform [[Spaced Repetition]] in a productive manner.
