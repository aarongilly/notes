**Do 2-4 hours of focused work. Force yourself to be productive or bored instead. De-clutter your schedule.**

Spend 2-4 Hours doing one thing really well

Force yourself to choose between being bored, or doing the thing you need to do. Eliminate other distractions from the environment.

De clutter your schedule, then don't fill it back up.
