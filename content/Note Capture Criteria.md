**4 Questions to Ask Yourself When Writing a Note**

To support capturing the “right” amount of information, all toward the following:

1. Is it inspiring me?
2. Is it useful?
3. Is it personal? (Is it yours, or something that was to you)
4. Is it surprising?
    
    if you already knew it, don't bother writing it down (unless it's particularly well said and you want to use that later)

In short: **capture what resonates**.
