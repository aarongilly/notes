**Judgment, we hope, would drive people toward a common conclusion. Opinion and taste are ok to be different.**

Judgment, by definition, is something that we would aspire to have multiple people trend toward a common conclusion. Judgment often is used in situations in which there is an objectively true measure that's being judged, but also there is judgment that's used when doing things like assessing what premiums to charge an insurance client. 

Opinion and taste, as opposed to judgement, is where we expect and accept large variances in conclusions to endure.
