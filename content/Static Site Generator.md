Static site generators turn content (stored either in databases or, more awesomely, in folders of Markdown files) into interactive websites. Static does *not* mean the website need be boring. It simply means the site is more or less *stateless*, and it's not "taking in" data from visitors for any purpose.

I've used:
- Jekyll - Ruby-based and what [aarongilly.com](https://aarongilly.com) runs on right now
- [[Quartz Publishing|Quartz]] - to host these notes 

I've tinkered with:
- Astro - which seems dope and will eventually host aarongilly.com

There are plenty of others I've no real experience with. Hugo. Gatsby. Eleventy.

Also you can make more "full-fledged" frameworks work like SSGs NextJS, SvelteKit, & Nuxt.
