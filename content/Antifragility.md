**Systems that are antifragile grow stronger in response to stressors**

**Antifragility**Â is a property of systems in which they increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures.

Antifragile is better than resilient. Resilient systems resist shocks and remains static. Antifragile systems respond to shocks dynamically to get stronger.

There is usually a limit on the size of the shock that can produce favorable results. In the case of weightlifting, for example, pulling a muscle by going to hard weaknes the muscle. Stressing the muscle within its capability to be healthily stressed with strengthen it. 

### Examples
- weightlifting and cardio
- trees and the wind
