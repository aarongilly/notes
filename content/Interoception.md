Interoception is your perception of the signals coming from within your own body. Your brain's connect to everything in your body, and the communication is bi-directional. Being able to perceive the signals your body is sending you is an instinct you're born with, and also a skill you can train through [[Meditation]] and [[Mindfulness & Now|mindfullness]].

Better interoception is associated with lower levels of depression, lower [[Anxiety]], better access to your [[Emotional Algorithms]] and the chance to recognize [[Emotional Decisions]] for what they are (note: this doesn't mean "avoid them"), amongst other benefits (see: [[Day Trading Interoceptors]]). It makes intuitive sense that you understanding the signals your body is sending you would set you up for a better life.

People with poor interoception don't have a good vocabulary for describing their inner state. They are "good", or "bad". They can't go very far in describing *how* they feel. Those who have a better perception of and understanding of the signals coming from within can say they are feeling "energized" or "insecure".

## Improving Interroception
You can train your interroceptive abilities and actually make meaningful improvements.

Techniques:
- [[Meditation]] - particularly the kind with body scanning
- Naming your emotions, very descriptively
- Biofeedback training - guessing your heart rate, then checking

## Interoception Test
There are a couple of ways, they both deal with your heart.

1. Count your heartbeat, not using your hand. 
2. Estimate your heart *rate*, then check it.
