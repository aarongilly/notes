Interoception is your perception of the signals coming from within your own body. Your brain's connect to everything in your body, and the communication is bi-directional. Being able to perceive the signals your body is sending you is an instinct you're born with, and also a skill you can train through [[Meditation]] and [[Mindfulness & Now|mindfullness]].

Better interoception is associated with lower levels of depression, lower [[Anxiety]], and other benefits. It makes intuitive sense that you understanding the signals your body is sending you would set you up for a better life.

People with poor interoception don't have a good vocabulary for describing their inner state. They are "good", or "bad". They can't go very far in describing *how* they feel. Those who have a better perception of and understanding of the signals coming from within can say they are feeling "energized" or "insecure".
