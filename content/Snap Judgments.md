**The result of nearly instantaneous calculations by the unconscious mind, for reasons which may not be articulatable **

Snap Judgments are the result of nearly instantaneous calculations by the unconscious mind, for reasons which may not be articulatable. They were the primary topic of the book [[Blink]] They can be incredibly helpful, but also incredibly harmful. 

### Good Examples

- A tennis legend was able to predict double-faults before they occurred with better than 90% accuracy, but could not understand how he knew
- Art historians spotted a fake statue within seconds, but couldn't explain what about it made them realize it was fake.

### Bad Examples (examples of bad ones)

- Implicit associations & unconscious bias (IAT)
- The Warren Harding Effect
