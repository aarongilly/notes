**You can treat new subjects as a black box at first.**

When approaching a new code base, basically just start playing around with it. Don't worry about “how it works” so much as “what are its inputs? What are its outputs?”

This gives you enough knowledge to start. And it lays the groundwork for when you DO decide you want to see how it works.
