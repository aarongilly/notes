I made this flowchart to illustrate where our money comes from and where it goes. It was super useful and enlightening to create, and I've kept it up-to-date over the years. It helped with creating a [[Budget]], figuring out the right amount for our [[Individual Retirement Accounts]] and [[529 Accounts]], and for "aiming" our [[Income Tax Overview|tax contributions]]. Here's the most recent version, with the actual numbers redacted. Ours includes the [[50-30-20 Rule]] for budgeting.
