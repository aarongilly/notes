**Intentional efforts made for the sake of receiving process feedback.**

Because [[Feedback is Key to Learning]], and we cannot study what we cannot measure, it is often necessary to *manufacture* feedback into your process/system.

Experiments are essentially excuses for creating feedback. 

Surveys are a rudimentary form of feedback. They serve as a lagging proxy measure for actual effectiveness. ([[Proxy Measures]], [[Lagging Measures]])

I much prefer situations where you can insert frictionless feedback at multiple points in a process, giving a chance for [[Leading Measures]] from early in the process.
