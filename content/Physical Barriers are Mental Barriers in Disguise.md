**If you set out to do 10 pushups, you’ll get tired at 9. If you set out to do 20, you’ll blow right past 9 without fatigue.**

While some physical barriers are genuine, many of the things that hold us back from achieving our potential are actual *mental* barriers in disguise as physical barriers. A study of cyclists had them cycle as fast as they could for 10 minutes on a stationary bike. Later they were tested again against a ghost of their previous performance. Unbeknownst to them, their ghosted avatar was actually sped up and cycled *faster* than their previous “best performance possible”… and yet most cyclists believing they were already capable of achieving that managed to not only keep up, but surpass their artificially enhanced performances.

> [!tldr] If you set out to do 10 pushups, you feel tired after 8 or 9. If you set out to do 20 pushups, you blow right by 8 or 9 without thinking about it or feeling the fatigue.
