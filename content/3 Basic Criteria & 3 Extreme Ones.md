A technique for evaluating potential options for a decision of any importance: Have three basic criteria, which must all be satisfied to weed out the obvious bad fits. Once all three of those criteria are satisfied by any given potential option, subject them to the next tear of extreme specialized criteria. If options don’t satisfy at least two of the three of those they are not good enough. 

This is basically using [[Frugal Models]] to see if it’s [[Hell Yes or No]].
