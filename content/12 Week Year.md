"The 12 Week Year" is a productivity book I haven't read yet. The main sales pitch of the book is similar to what GCPGrey's "Themes" - that you should organize your life around 12 week "sprints" (to borrow an [[Agile]] term). To do quarterly [[Periodic Reviews]].

The idea is that 12 weeks is long enough to do something significant, but short enough to maintain a sense of urgency. It also gives you a chance to start again relatively quickly if you end up crapping out on a set of goals. This particular methodology suggests forming weekly [[KPIs]] to keep yourself accountable and motivated. 

This is basically a slice of the [[Antifragile Planning Method]].
