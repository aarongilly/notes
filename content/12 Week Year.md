"[[The 12 Week Year]]" is a productivity book. The main sales pitch of the book is similar to what GCPGrey's "Themes" - that you should organize your life around 12 week "sprints" (to borrow an [[Agile]] term). To do quarterly [[Periodic Reviews]].

### Why 12 Weeks
The idea is that **12 weeks is long enough to do something significant, but short enough to maintain a sense of urgency**. It also gives you a chance to start again relatively quickly if you end up crapping out on a set of goals. It shortens the horizon of your *predictions* when making plans, making your predictions about the future less likely to accumulate differences to the point where your plan no longer makes sense.

This particular methodology suggests forming weekly [[KPIs]] to keep yourself accountable and motivated. It made me realized the practice of pairing leading & lagging indicators is good because [[Leading indicators measure strategy adherence and lagging indicators measure strategy effectiveness]].

This is basically a slice of the [[Antifragile Planning Method]].
