**Redux is a dedicated state management framework.**

Redux bills itself as "A Predictable State Container for JS Apps". It is a dedicated state management framework built independently from React, although it seems like it was "meant" to work with React. There's an *official* React-Redux library.

## Uses

- It enables better state testing
- It enables you to build state-dependent features, like undo/redo and persistence
