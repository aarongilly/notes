Ever **Just because you didn’t think of a solution before, doesn’t mean you couldn’t today.**

## Most Problems are Solvable

It is incredibly easy to take your current problems as “the way things are” and stop looking for solutions. It is okay to let some problems go on as problems for a while; but you should periodically come back to the problems in your life and environment and take a fresh look at solving them.

> [!tldr] 🔑 Intermittently take stock of your problems & take a fresh look for solutions

## Give it a Googs

If something is giving you trouble, you can ***almost always*** find a solution online. Describe the problem to Google and you’re likely to find you’re not alone. Often, you’ll find a solution. Time and time again I find solutions to something I’d previously “accepted” as an unavoidable deficiency.
