**We have a four-part system that Manages our attention.**

**Human Attentional System**

1. The Central Executive - what youâ€™re consciously aware of. Able to [[focus]] for extended periods of time on specific things.
2. The [[Default Network]] - a daydreaming mode. Boredom. The mind thinks autobiographically. You process goals. Remember things. Vaguely think about the future.
3. The [[Attentional Filter]] - a constantly-running unconscious process which brings things (usually changes or other important things) to the attention. Allows you to basically drive without thinking about it, but still notice and react when a potentially dangerous situation is approaching.
4. The [[Attentional Switch]] - a part of the brain that allows the central executive function to switch its focus from one thing to another
