**Projects are divisible into tasks, milestones, and goals.**

Projects aren't accomplished in one go. That is essentially what defines something as a “project” ([[Defining Project ]]), as opposed to a task.

Projects are composed of different types of things:

- Tasks ([[Action→Task→Project→Area Hierarchy]])
- Constraints - timeframes, budget, capabilities, etc
- Interim deliverables (Milestones)
- Goals (e.g. complete by X)
- Customers - who cares the project is done, aka who "receives value"

It's a best practice to utilize a [[Project Management App]] to organize and interact with your [[Project Lists]] and the tasks/constraints/notes/goals/deliverables

You can utilize [[Minimum Viable Progress]] consistently to complete big projects over time without burnout. ([[Small but Consistent beats Big but Sporadic ]], [[Heavy Lifts vs Slow Burns]]).
