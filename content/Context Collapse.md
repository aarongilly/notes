**The public nature of any tweet means you are only capable of telling one version of a story to any potential audience member - your parents, friends, lovers, future employers, and worst enemies are jammed together**

There is an absolute void of context on Twitter. The public nature of any tweet means you are only capable of telling one version of a story to any potential audience member - your parents, friends, lovers, future employers, and worst enemies are jammed together. **Any natural form of communication is bound to spatial and temporal context**. The people here now are going to hear what you're saying and be able to relate it to what's been said, what's been happening, and who you are in al of those things. This doesn't work online.
