**Don't let standard project metrics outweigh value-delivery metrics.**

If you get too wrapped up in [[Metrics]] about how well a project is completed *on-time* and *on-budget*, you begin to lose sight to the fact that the project should also drive some sort of business value. You can have a million projects all done perfectly on time and on budget and have your company tank because none of them offered actual [[Business Value]]

> [!tldr] just because something was done on-time and on-budget doesn't mean it was a good idea to do
