**Central Repository of integrated, historical data from disparate sources**

A staple of business intelligence, a data warehouse is a central repository of integrated, historical (and sometimes current) data from many disparate sources. Enabling a common interface and data history, as a data warehouse contains **copies** of the data, as opposed to the data staying in the source locations.

Gave rise to the terminology "facts" & "dimensions". ([[Facts vs Dimensions]])
