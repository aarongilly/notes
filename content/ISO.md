**International Organization for Standardization - a group that defines a bunch of standards.**

The International Organization for Standards (ISO) is a body of people headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, that agree upon the "official" standards for all sorts of things. They are the largest such body, and by far the most impactful. Their standards have been integrated into all sorts of disciplines. ISO have 20,000+ standards that cover a **huge** range of topics. The "official" standard you have to pay for, but generally their content is also available freely online.

## Some Standards Topics

- Film sensitivity level in cameras ("ISO" settings)
- Time & Date serialization ([[ISO 8601]])
- Location serialization ([[ISO 6709]])
- Visual Systems Design ([[UML]])
- Disk images ("ISOs")

Note ISO has **nothing to do with** the [[International System of Units]].
