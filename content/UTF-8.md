 **Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit binary-to-character encoding. The king character encoding schema for modern files.**

UTF-8 is what runs the web. It's what you should use to make [[Durable File Types|durable files]]. It builds on ASCII, (it's a superset of it) and adds Unicode Characters. It uses "blocks", 8 bits in length, to represent characters. These blocks can be chained together to reach higher numbers of characters.
