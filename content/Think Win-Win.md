**Always look for mutually beneficial resolutions to every transaction.**

Habit 4 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Think Win-Win.

This is basically what it sounds like. If you want [[Interdependence]] (which the book advocates) you can't have transactions in which one party feels as though they lost. 

> [!tldr] ⚠️ All transactions are win-win, win-lose, lose-win, or lose-lose.

The recommended approach is always, when possible, go into a transaction with a "win-win or no deal" agreement. Remember, because it's worth pointing out even though it's obvious - **you losing does not mean a win-win transaction has occurred**.
