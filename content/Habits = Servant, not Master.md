**Habits are a good servant, a terrible master. **

Habits are a good servant. They get you to where you want to be. They make you who you are. However, they are a terrible master. If you find yourself mindlessly executing routines that bring you no joy and serve no purpose, you're not living any more.

> [!tldr] ➡️ Ask yourself: "To what end am I pursuing this habit?"
