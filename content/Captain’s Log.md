**Writing down what time it is, what you did, and what’s next**

Captain’s Log (or “Temporal Journaling” or or “Interstitial Journaling”) is a time-tracking productivity technique for being more mindful of your usage of time & for giving yourself a “game tape” to review in the execution of your knowledge work (like someone watching themselves play sports to see how they could be better). 

You make an entry when you **change tasks, take a break, or get distracted** and **include the time, what happened, and what’s next**.

### Example:

```
08:30 started day. Next: triage email.
9:15 distracted by captains log thoughts, next: reading article
10:17 wrote Captain's Log note. Next: finish email triage
```
