**Waffling is a cause of unhappiness & it's unproductive.**

Most decisions in life aren't consequential enough to **really** require the amount of thought at worry people tend to give them. The path not taken should not be of your concern.

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘Œ Stick with the plan.

Make decisions, then be done with them. Waffling is a cause of unhappiness. It also is unproductive. Use [[Satisficing]]. Stick with the plan. Unless something **REALLY** isn't working, just keep going with it. This is also a core part of the [[Antifragile Planning Method]].
