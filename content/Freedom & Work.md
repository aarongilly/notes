**True freedom is the ability to work only when, where, and how you want.**

In his book, Tim Ferris uses the term the "New Rich" to describe those that are (at least) decently well-off in terms of **income** and *very* well-off in terms of **freedom**. In particular, he places a great value on freedom of time and freedom of location. You get freedom of time by achieving your income with as little day-to-day hour-to-hour commitments as possible. Freedom of location comes from establishing an income stream that can be maintained from anywhere on the globe with an internet (or phone) connection.
