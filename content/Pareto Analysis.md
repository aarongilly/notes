**Application of the Pareto Principle to reduce the effective arity of a function in order to better control it.**

Pareto Analysis is the systematic application of the [[Pareto Principle]] to a given function, typically with the goal of optimizing creating effective/consistent/productive the function's outputs against the effort spent controlling the function's outputs. As the Pareto Principle states, not every input is equally impactful. By sacrificing control over some little-impactful inputs, you may be able to direct energy toward controlling those inputs that have large impacts. This reduces the effective [[Arity]] of the function, decreasing complexity while increasing capacity for control.

Typically the result of a Pareto Analysis is presented in a chart like this:
