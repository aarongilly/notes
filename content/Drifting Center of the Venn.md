**The Venn Diagram of "what I like", "what I'm good at", and "what pays" changes over time.**

The intersection of what we do well, what we want to do, and what we can be paid to do is constantly changing. Market forces change what you can expect to be paid for. Interests change. Abilities develop. You have to spend some time in the intersection at any given moment in order to gain the traction necessary to make progress... but also you must take time periodically to pull your head up and see where the Venn Diagram has shifted.

This practice can be a good addition to a [[Periodic Reviews]].
