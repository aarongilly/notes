**Making a guess, then seeing if you’re right.**

Science is, essentially, the practice observing specific cases within a system, using those observations to make a general hypothesis of how the system works, then coming up with testable predictions about things you don’t based on this hypothesis. (note: this is called "[[Inductive vs Deductive|inductive reasoning]]").

If your predictions are consistently accurate, you MIGHT be right. 

There’s a whole method for how to go about making predictions and the specifics of testing them. It’s named [[The Scientific Method]].
