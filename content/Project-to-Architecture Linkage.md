If you want a good [[Enterprise Architecture]], you have to build one **and** maintain it *intentionally*. It's not simply enough to go "buy" (if that's even possible) and off-the shelf solution and be done with it. The projects of which your business undertakes must be "folded-in", or you will quickly end up with a disjointed mishmash - a death by 1,000 cuts. This is [[Maintaining Intentional Designs]] for EAs.

There are 3 classes of "linkage":
1. **Architecture Linkage** - aligning projects to *architecture* by embedding architects in project teams, adding architecture reviews, making funding contingent upon architecture compliance, etc
2. **Business Linkage** - aligning projects to *business goals* by involving business sponsors, aligning [[incentives]] to business goal outcomes, holding project reviews with leadership
3. **Alignment Linkage** - aligning architecture & business goals by keeping IT and business managers communicating, utilizing a PMO
