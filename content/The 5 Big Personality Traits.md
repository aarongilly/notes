**extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.**

The "Big Five" or "OCEAN" model is a widely held belief that a person's personality can be broken down mostly into 5 core factors, each of which exist on a continuum; and that those 5 factors remain mostly stable throughout a person's life.

### Conscientiousness
Impulsive & disorganized vs disciplined & careful

### Agreeableness
Suspicious & uncooperative vs trusting & helpful

### Neuroticism
Calm & confident vs anxious & pessimistic

### Openness
Preferring routine & Practicality vs imaginative & spontaneous

### Extraversion
Reserved & thoughtful vs sociable & fun-loving

In [[Blink]] a study was described that showed that [[Thin Slicing]] gave better overall estimates of these traits for a person than their own friends could produce.

In [[The Sentiment Machine]] a study was described that showed how analysis of fewer than 100 "likes" on Facebook could yield highly accurate depictions of the OCEAN traits, which was exploited my Cambridge Analytica in their advertising for the Trump campaign in 2016.
