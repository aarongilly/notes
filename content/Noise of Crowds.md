**Wisdom of the crowd only works when their inputs are made independently.**

The “wisdom of the crowd” is only true if the judgments made by the crowd are all independent. If judgments are made publicly, then the advantage not only goes away, but can be *worse* than that of an individual. People have to respond to whoever’s opinion is shared first. The first movers opinion holds a massively disproportionate sway over what the final result will be. This is an obvious example of [[Noise]] .
