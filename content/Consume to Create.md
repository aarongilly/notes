**Consume through a lens of creation.**

With a Second Brain, you are enabled to constantly consume new ideas through a lens of "what can I glean from this to add to my personal system."  This brings out deeper consumption. Deeper thought about what you're being told. 

Ask yourself - "How can I use this?""
