**You need time & space free from distraction to actually progress on anything.**

There is a non-linear curve of return on effort for any given cognitive activity. It takes time to perform the necessary [[Context Loading]] and get over the inertial resistance inherent in any effort. Distracting environments operate your [[Attentional Switch]] and prevent you from making progress while tiring you out. 

## Getting Traction

The book "[[Indistractable]]" recommends a ton of options. There are options from other books as well, already noted here.

- [[Time Blocking]]
- [[A Firm & Polite “No”]]
- [[Decide and Move On]]
