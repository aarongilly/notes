**Areas have KPIs, Projects meet OKRs**

The [[PARA Method]]'s concept of an "Area" ([[Defining Area ]]) are linked in form to  KPI-type measurements ([[KPIs]]). As neither Areas nor KPI generally have no "end" state.

Meanwhile Projects and OKRs are both time-bound and dynamic. ( [[Defining Project]] & [[OKRs]])

Both of which should be reviewed periodically on a consistent, recurring basis. 

Projects fall in areas. Therefore Areas are associated with OKRs *through* projects.
