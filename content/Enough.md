**Don’t search for more, search for enough.**

The desire for more is not quenched by getting more. Those that seek to become rich and powerful, after having achieved riches and power, inevitably find themselves wanting more. 

> [!tldr] 👉🏻 **If you were able to push a button that magically granted unto you everything you're working for today, and imposed all of the changes to the external world you'd wish to see, would you be happy and content after pushing that button?**

If you suddenly had everything you ever wanted, if you achieved all your wildest dreams, you'll have at most probably 3 weeks of happiness before reverting back to your [[Hedonic Treadmill|Hedonic Set Point]]. So they key to happiness is NOT getting everything you want and achieving all your wildest dreams. 

As James Clear says: [[Love the Process]]. As Neil Pasricha said: ==Be Happy First==.

Anything beyond "enough" is [[Clutter]].
