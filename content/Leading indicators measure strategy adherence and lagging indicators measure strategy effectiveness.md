While I've known for some time it's best to pair leading indicators with lagging indicators, I hadn't realized the relationship between them and how they can be used for *long-term strategic learning*. This is one great reason why **pairing leading & lagging indicators is a best practice** for [[Good Metrics]].

- **[[Leading Measures]]** indicate how well you are adhering to the strategy (or the plan).  
- **[[Lagging Measures]]** indicate how well the strategy (or plan) works.

James Clear's quote comes to mind: [[Failure is most useful when you give your best effort.]]
