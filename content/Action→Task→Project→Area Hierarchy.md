**Areas contain Projects, Projects contain Tasks, Tasks contain Actions.**

There's a basic hierarchy of work to be done. 

## Hierarchy

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ Actions â†’ Tasks â†’ Projects â†’ Areas

This hierarchy is by no means the only possible way to break down work. A series of Projects can be put together and called a "Program", for example.  Nor is this a *true* hierarchy. Any given action may satisfy multiple tasks, which themselves may satisfy multiple projects, which themselves may be relevant to multiple areas.

It does, however, clearly delineate the different mindsets with which you should think about the work to be done. Areas shouldn't be treated like Projects, Projects shouldn't be treated like tasks, and tasks shouldn't be treated like Actions.

## Example

- Area - health
    - Project - get a flu shot
        - Task - figure out how to get a flu shot
	        - Action - Google "how to get a flu shot"
