**The cornerstone of essentialism and minimalism.**

“**Less, but better**” is the core message of the book “Essentialism” by Greg McKeown. It is doing fewer things overall, but putting more energy into those things ([[Minimal Activities]]). It’s about reducing the scope of your concerns to those that truly matter, then managing those things better. (to avoid [[Majoring in Minor Work]])

This message is very similar to the core message of “Digital Minimalism” by Cal Newport, which is closer to “less *is* better”.
