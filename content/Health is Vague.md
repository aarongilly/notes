**"Healthy" has a different definition depending on who you ask.**

"Healthy" has a different definition depending on who you ask. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) have changed their minds over time on how one should define "Health".

For some "Health" is simply "the absence of disease".

## World Health Organization Definition

> physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity - *1948 WHO definition*
> 

> the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities - *1984 WHO definition*
> 

The definition of "health" is subject to an individuals interpretation (like all definitions, really). This highlights the need for medical practitioners to be good listeners and understand the patient's definition of "health", so they can guide their treatments to suit what's best for their patient.

# My General Definition

Healthy - *adjective* - able to enjoy the fruits of whatever aspects of life an individual finds valuable free from undue physical, mental, and emotional hardships.
