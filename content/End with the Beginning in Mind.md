**When you stop working on a thing, think about what you’ll start with next time you pick it up, make that process easier for your future self.**

When it comes to executing large projects Or creative works, it helps to end one chunk of work knowing exactly what you'll pick up on next. You don't need to know anything beyond your next one single step, but you should have the beginning of the next working session in mind when you end this one. This carries  today's momentum into tomorrow. It doesn't leave you in a state where you've exhausted all ideas and energy, only to start anew next time - possibly in a completely disconnected place. 

Earnest Hemingway did this when he was writing.

This is also a playoff of Stephen Covey's advice to “[[Begin with the End in Mind]] ”.
