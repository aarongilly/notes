High-Intensity Interval Training is great. it is the quickest way to raise your VO2 Max. It should probably be done a couple of times a week.

### Fast facts:

- HIIT is often something like ~20 seconds of max effort, followed by 40 seconds of rest.
- You should use an interval timer, probably an app, because if you're doing it right you won't have the mental capacity to keep watch on a clock and count things.
- You should be hitting your peak [[Heart Rate Zones]]
