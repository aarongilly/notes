**GitHub files/gists and npm uploads are embedded with Script tags**

GitHub Gists can be embedded via Script Tags. So can any public GitHub file, actually.

Anyone can create an [[Coding Package Manager|NPM]] account and upload packages. Those packages can be installed via npm, or got in a script tag via CDNs like jsdelivr.

...or you could just make a Google Apps Script with an endpoint that delivers a text file.

## Examples

GitHub Gist

```html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/aarongilly/58163e4387e6e4c6ccfb8e97062e59c2.js"></script>
```
