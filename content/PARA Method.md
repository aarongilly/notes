**Organize the same way, regardless of tool.**

There is no silver bullet tool that is the best at accomplishing everything. You utilize many different apps and resources in your “stack”. Each of these tools should have a well understood intent, and their usage should be relatively contained to that intent. 

The PARA Method of organization suggests that you do not have a per-tool system, instead that you have a consistent system of groups, that are reflected across each of the layers of your productivity and knowledge management stack. This enables consistency for how you organize and manage your work and life across applications, but also allows you to utilize the tools for the jobs for which they are best suited.
