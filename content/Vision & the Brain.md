**What you see as "the present" is actually a prediction your brain makes 1/5th of a second into the future.**

The eyes send 100 billion signals every second. The biggest part of seeing isnâ€™t coming from the eye, but through a function to processing from something else. That takes time. The Brain compensates for that processing time by forecasting 1/5th of a second into the future and presenting that forecast as the present.
