Interoceptive Shuttling (or just "Shuttling" as it's referred to in [[The Extended Mind]]) is a technique for taking in the whole of any given situation or circumstance. It's a practice in which you *intentionally* shift your focus back and forth from the world around you, then toward [[Interoception]] , paying attention to the world going on inside you. This gives you the fullest picture of whatever the situation is. It lets you tap into your [[Adaptive Unconscious]] while giving the [[Central Executive]] the chance to make the ultimate call with all the facts.
