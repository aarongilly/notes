**Treat the question you're trying to solve as an answer, figure out what question it answers, find other ways to answer it.**

When you're stuck on a problem, and in a rut trying to answer a question - change that question into the form of an *answer*, then ask yourself what question *that* answer is for, then consider other possible answers to that question.

## Example

Original Quesiton:

How do I find a spouse?

Question as an answer:

I find a spouse.

What question is that an answer to?

How do I feel more companionship?

Alternative answers:

Sure, a spouse would work. But also a satisfying close personal friendship. Perhaps a pet?

This is essentially a cousin exercise of the [[5 Whys]].
