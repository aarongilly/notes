summary: ~1 page explaining simply where you're playing and how you'll win.

Because [[A Plan is Not a Strategy]], strategies don't have to be (and *shouldn't* be) complicated. You should be able to write your [[What is a Strategy|strategy]] down on ~1 sheet of paper. It should lay out the logic simply, not hide behind [[Avoid Jargon|jargon]] (see: [[Feynman Technique]]), and it should cover:

## Component Breakdown
1. Here's where we're playing
2. Here's how we're choosing to win
3. Here's the capabilities we need

This is all per [the Harvard Business Review video](https://youtu.be/iuYlGRnC7J8), but there is no *universally agreed upon* strategy document. 

## Alternative Component Breakdown
* Cross-section of random Google results
	* [[Mission Statement]] 
	* Vision for the future
	* [[SWOT Analysis]]
* [Another HBR source](https://hbr.org/2011/06/strategy-on-one-page)
	* Why do you exist?
	* What is your value proposition?
	* Who are you serving?
	* How do you know you're winning?
* Wikipedia's article on Strategy
	* Diagnosis explaining the challenge
	* Guiding policy for dealing with the challenge
	* Coherent actions for carrying out the policy
