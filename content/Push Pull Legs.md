Push, pull, legs. 3 days. You basically blast a muscle group once/week. 

I'm trialing a Push, Pull, Legs routine from 1/1/2024 to 4/1/2024. Results to follow maybe.
## Muscle Groups
- Push
	- Chest
	- Triceps
	- Front Delts
	- Side Delts
- Pull
	- Back 
	- Biceps 
	- Pull-ups 
	- Rear delts
- Legs
	- abs 
	- glutes 
	- hamstrings 
	- calves 
	- quads.
