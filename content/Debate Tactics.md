**How to be effective in a debate.**

Debating is [[Task Oriented, not Personal]]. Expert debaters make fewer better points and are more willing to find a common ground. Making a lot of arguments for your position is worse than making a few very strong arguments for it. *Your argument is only as strong as your weakest point*. Once people start not buying the arguments you make a fall like dominoes. This recommendation, though, is not a panacea. The right argument is situation and person dependent.

Also don't use a straw man for an opponent's arguments. Use address their strongest argument, find common ground, and use questions to find where the debate can go. A good question is "what evidence would you need to see to change your opinion"?
