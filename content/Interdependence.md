**Dependence < Independence < Intederpedence**

There's a hierarchy of dependence & effectiveness. It goes dependence < independence < interdependence.

## Dependence

The lowest form of effectiveness. I need your help to accomplish my task. Children are dependent upon their parents. First-day employees are dependent on their more tenured coworkers. 

*Here's your fish.*

## Independence

A mid-tier effectiveness. I don't need your help to accomplish my task. I am empowered with the agency, knowhow, capability, and willingness to do so on my own. I can fight for myself. I will get for myself what I need. Most adults are independent.

*I'll catch my own fish.*

## Interdependence

High-tier effectiveness. Interdependence moves beyond the individual, to groups of people working together to accomplish more than the sum of their parts. Interdependence allows for high-tier specialization to occur while keeping all the bases covered. Your organs are interdependent upon one-another. 

*You catch fish for the whole team, I'll build the fire, and she'll set up our shelter.*
