**Group time spent on like-tasks together to minimize context-switching and maximize throughput.**

**Task batching** is the practice of working categories of task (e.g. answering email) all at once, rather than on an adhoc, on-going basis.  

### Task Batching & Time Blocking

A more rigid approach to [[Time Blocking]] is to insert blocks of time of whatever duration into your day in which you will work on a predefined task, [[Defining Project|project]], or [[Defining Area|area]]. During that block, work toward whatever goal you set up for yourself. 

Blocks may be defined set up to work toward something general (e.g. “do email”), or something specific (e.g. “achieve inbox zero”). They may be defined broadly (e.g. “physical wellness”), or very specifically (e.g. “send notes to recap the weekly meeting”).

## Benefits

- Minimize the negative effects of [[Context Loading]]
- Staves off [[Decision Fatigue]]
