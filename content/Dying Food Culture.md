**We stopped enjoying food. Instead it's been relegated as a means to an end.**

“Food Culture” is the term recently coined to talk about what used to just be the only way people lived - a deep appreciation and ritual around the gathering, cooking, preparation, and consumption of food. We've moved towards convenience foods and fast foods. They have largely become a means to an end. 

We aren't appreciating what's been a vital part of the human experience for all of history and we're less nourished thanks to our efforts. Good used to be [[Enough]].
