**A poem about good coding principles.**

> **The Zen of Python - by Tim Peters**
> 
> - Beautiful is better than ugly.
> - Explicit is better than implicit.
> - Simple is better than complex.
> - Complex is better than complicated.
> - Flat is better than nested.
> - Sparse is better than dense.
> - Readability counts.
> - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> - Although practicality beats purity.
> - Errors should never pass silently.
> - Unless explicitly silenced.
> - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> - There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
> - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> - Now is better than never.
> - Although never is often better than *right* now.
> - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> - Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!

The “one and preferably only one” has two different types of hyphen spacings on purpose.
