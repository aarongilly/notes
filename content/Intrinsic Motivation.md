**Doing it for you is the best way to do good work that you enjoy.**

Intrinsic Motivation is something that comes from *within*. You do a thing because ***you*** want to do it, not because anybody else wants you to do it, or because doing it will get you some form of reward. 

> [!tldr] üëâ Intrinsic motivation is the **best** way to do good work that you enjoy.

 It brings about **Flow** and produces superior results over things we only do because we'll get some form of reward, or because someone else has forced us to do it.

What do you want to do? ‚Üê Do that more often.
