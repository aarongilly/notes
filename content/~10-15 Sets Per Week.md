**A good target for each body part for hypertrophy.**

~13 sets for each [[Major Muscle Groups|Muscle Group]] per week is apparently a good recommendation by many people in the “science-based fitness” community. Beginners are slightly less than 13, intermediate are maybe slightly over 13. 

But also there is a [[Law of Diminishing Returns]] with reps. [[Pareto Principle]] applies here. You can do a lot with just a little bit of working out. You can maintain with a surprisingly small volume - just one or two good, hard-fought sets per week.

This is ideally split out over two (to 4) workout sessions. So, 7 sets for shoulders on Tuesday, another 6 on Friday. 

**Note**: this is for **ideal** growth. It's not *necessary* for muscle growth. I've seen recommendations that suggest this probably recommending a bit too much. It depends on how much you want to train.
