**`= this.summary`**

Zone 2 is a heart rate zone. It's associated with the ability to continue to hold conversations, and to avoid [[Mouth Breathing]]. It's where body is more predisposed to burn *fat* as opposed to glucose.

It's all the rage right now. It's also possible that it's *always* been important and I'm only just now seeing it everywhere due to the [[Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon]].
