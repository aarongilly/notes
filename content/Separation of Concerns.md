**A good principle for writing code**

When it comes to writing code, especially on large code-bases, a good principle to aim for is maintaining separation of concerns. Each thing should have one, fairly self-contained purpose. There should not be implicit dependencies, or explicit-but-surprising dependencies between disparate chunks of code.

Separation of Concerns is the reason that we like [[Highly Cohesive, Loosely Coupled]] code.
