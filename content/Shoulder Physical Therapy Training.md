**A few moves to support the stability of the shoulder.**
## Dumbbell Moves
### I Y T
All 3 done laying flat on a table (or something) while holding LIGHT (2-3lbs) dumbbells, hinging about the shoulders, keeping your arms straight. Each done for sets of 10. Could do 2 rounds.
- I - arms straight up over your head, thumbs up
- Y - arms go up to make a Y, thumbs up
- T - arms straight out, thumbs parallel to floor

### Rotation
Laying on the side, laying on your side with your elbow stacked on your side. Hold ~5lbs. Rotate the shoulder to swing the hand up. You can do both external and internal movements:

## Banded Moves
### Wall Slides
Loop band in a circle around wrists. Place hands flat on a wall. Keeping your left hand still, take your right hand ↗️, then back to neutral, ➡️, then back, ↘️, then back. That's one set. Do 10 sets. Then do the opposite arm the same way.
I have also seen a variation where you just walk your hands back and forth across a wall.
### Rotation
Same move as dumbbell rotation, but with bands and done while standing. 

#### Bodyweight
### Shoulder Push-ups
Shoulder retraction/extension while in an incline push-up position. Keep arms stuff, elbows locked, but raise and lower your body with just your shoulders.
	- Alternative, do a push-up, but add in a "cat"-like yoga stretch
