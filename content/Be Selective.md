**Never settle for something that‚Äôs less than a 90% fit for your life.**

> [!tldr] [[Hell Yes or No]]

There's a TED Talk that says **"if the answer isn't 'Hell Yes' the answer should be 'No'."** A closet shouldn't be full of clothes that "I might wear someday in the future". They should be full of clothes you absolutely love. The essence of üëâ [[Less, but Better]]

**The 90% rule:** if you're evaluating an option, and come up with some criteria for whether or not it's a good fit ‚Äî if the option is below a 90% fit, it's not good enough. If you accept everything that *might* be a good fit, you won't have space for the things that come along that actually **are**.

> [!tldr] ‚û°Ô∏è Make decisions by design, rather than default.

It can be more fulfilling, AND more financially lucrative to be the best at one thing, than to be good at everything.
