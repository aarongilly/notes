**Never settle for something that‚Äôs less than a 90% fit for your life.**

There's a TED Talk that says **"if the answer isn't 'Hell Yes' the answer should be 'No'."** A closet shouldn't be full of clothes that "I might wear someday in the future". They should be full of clothes you absolutely love. The essence of üëâ [[Less, but Better]]

**The 90% rule:** if you're evaluating an option, and come up with some criteria for whether or not it's a good fit ‚Äî if the option is below a 90% fit, it's not good enough. If you accept everything that *might* be a good fit, you won't have space for the things that come along that actually **are**.

> [!tldr] ‚û°Ô∏è Make decisions by design, rather than default.

It can be more fulfilling, AND more financially lucrative to be the best at one thing, than to be good at everything. This is a specific case of Ron Swanson's quote:

> "Don't Half Ass Two Things. Whole-ass One Thing." - Nick Offerman
