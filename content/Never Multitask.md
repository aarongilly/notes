**Some multitasking is possible, but multitasking within a channel should be avoided at all costs. **

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ Multitasking isn't getting a lot of things done at once, it's getting nothing done on a lot of different avenues simultaneously.

Multitasking, the ways most people traditionally think of it, is not "working on many things at once", it's *rapidly switching between between working on several things before any of them are finished*. This is a bad habit, as each of those switches involves switching contexts in your head. Your mental RAM is consumed by multiple applications at once, and you're only able to maintain surface-level thoughts and information about each of the constituent tasks you're working on. See [[Context Loading]]. 

Worse, constantly using the [[Attentional Switch]] leads to quicker [[Decision Fatigue]].

The one exception to this guidance is [[Multichannel Multitasking]].
