**A Buddhist parable about a man hit by a boat that teaches the responsibility lies with you.**

A Buddhist parable about a man on a large river taking his farmers hall to the market. He sees an oncoming boat and attempts to see you around it. At a certain point he stops and starts yelling at the boat "hey man, you are going to hit my boat!" The two boats collide the farmer loses his haul. He peers into the boat to yell at the person responsible and finds that the boat was empty. It had come unmoored and the only person responsible was him.

You are the only one responsible. You cannot expect an empty boat to behave any differently. You cannot expect a person to be anyone other than themselves no more than you can expect a boat not to be a boat.
