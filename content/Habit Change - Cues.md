**Make habit cues obvious & be specific about intentions.**

# Rule #1: Make it obvious

Noticing cues is more difficult over time. **Awareness** is key, and difficult. Point and call train operators are intentionally keeping up awareness. The habit version of this is a “Habit Scorecard”. Literally just try to list out all your Habits throughout the day, then assign them a simple score for how they benefit or harm you in the long run. You could verbalize your own habits to be even more aware of them. “I’m going to have this energy drink, even though it’s bad for me.”

## Be specific

Implementation intentions are good for follow through. "I will exercise at 6am in the home gym on Weekdays" is better than "I will exercise more". Time and location are necessary details. [[Habit Stacking]]  is using a current habit as a cue for the habit you want. "I will exercise after I make coffee" (not a great example). You can write down a list of all the habits you want, then write down a list of things that you do every day, or things that happen to you every day... then map between them.
