**You cannot grow without being uncomfortable.**

You cannot grow without being uncomfortable. If you're constantly comfortable in your work, school, or hobbies - you've stagnated. You're not growing. **A culture of being okay with some level of discomfort is necessary to improve people or processes in an institution.** Discomfort is motivation. Vulnerability is very uncomfortable, and [[Vulnerability is Necessary]]. Also - [[Good Feedback Requires Vulnerability]].
