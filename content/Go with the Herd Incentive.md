**People respond to what other’s are doing. Use that when designing nudges.**

When it came to motivating change in power conserving behavior in California, survey respondents said they would respond best to a moral incentive, then a fiscal one, and finally a “because everyone else is” one. In reality, when given different energy saving flyers based on the three incentives, the flyer that was by far and away most effective at reducing energy use was one that said you should save energy because your neighbors are. When designing motivational “nudges”, a social push can be very effective.
