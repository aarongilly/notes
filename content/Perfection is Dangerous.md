**Perfection is a dangerous and sometimes harmful concept.**

Perfection doesnâ€™t exist in reality. Perfection of self, perfection in any performance is an impossible task. Being unsatisfied with anything less than perfect is a dangerous game to play. You can harm your self-worth and happiness by expecting the unreasonable.

> **Things that exist have flaws.**
