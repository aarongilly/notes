**Play is essential. Don't ever stop playing.**

The partaking of activities for fun, with no end in mind. Play is essential. It sparks exploration. It opens you up to options and opportunities. 

**If your project does not have an associated goal, itâ€™s a hobby**. 

Play opens up the mind to new ideas. It relieves stress, and stress causes unclear thinking.
