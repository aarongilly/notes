**What some [[Tax Index|Tax]] terms mean, mostly from the 1040**

Directly from the [[1040 Analysis]].

**Total income** - what's called your "Taxable Gross" at work, it's gross minus [[Tax-Deferred|pre-tax]] deductions

**Adjustments to income** - adding income from other sources, subtracting expenses for school

**Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** - Total Income + Adjustments to Income

**Standard Deduction** - the baseline you may choose to use

**Other Deductions** - 
	"Above-the-line" deductions - these apply on top of the Standard Deduction
		- ==Educator expenses==
		- Some self-employment stuff
		- Student loan interest
	"Itemized" deductions - these apply only if you're itemizing:
		- Medical/Dental expenses
		- State/local income & property taxes
		- Home mortgage interest
		- Gifts to charity
		- Losses to theft

**Deduction Total** - Standard (or Itemized) deductions + above-the-line deductions

**Taxable Income** - your AGI less your Deduction Total

**Tax** - where your Taxable Income meets the Piecewise Linear Tax Line

**Payments & Credits** - how much you've been credited (childcare, mostly, for me)
	These credits could take your tax liability to $0, but no further
	
**Total Tax** - Tax less Credits

**Other Payments / Refund Credits** - in 2021 Child Credits showed up here.
	These could take your liability *below* $0
	
**Payments** - the total of *Federal Income Tax* from W2s

**Total Payments** - Payments + Refund Credits

**Refund** - Total Payments - Total Tax
