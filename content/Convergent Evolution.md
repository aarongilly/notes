**Convergent Evolution** is the term used to describe when similar traits/features start to pop up in creatures that don't share any recent ancestors. It’s sort of like an evolutionary best practices. 
### Examples of Convergent Evolution 
- Thumbs - humans, possums, chameleons
- Bats & Birds
- [Everything turns into a crab](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/)
- Trees - different types of trees come from wildly different backgrounds, apparently. 
### Societal Equivalent
You *could* say that similar ideas/inventions **that were formulated in a vacuum** would be a case of **convergent innovation**. This is probably less common in the real world than simple [[Imitation]]/copying… but also it doesn’t matter. [[Notion]] comes out and suddenly there are a *lot* of Notion-like products come out the woodworks.
