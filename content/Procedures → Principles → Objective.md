**Have a documented Strategic Objective, Guiding Principles, and Working Procedures. Use them and improve them.**

The entire message of the book [[Work the System]] boils down to 3 basic documents you need to make and use:

1. Strategic Objective (the Declaration of Independence) 
    
    A single-page document describing the overall direction you want to take in your professional and personal life (see: [[What is a Strategy]])
    
2. Operating Principles - the Bill of Rights
    
    These are guidelines for decision making.
    
3. Working Procedures- the laws themselves
    
    These are a collection of protocols that detail how your life systems operate. These are your [[Standard Processes]]. 95% of them will follow a 1-2-3 step format. The other 5% may be narratives. These should be accessible by a layperson, unambiguous, and adhered to without deviation. IF there needs to be a deviation, the procedure itself should be altered, on the spot without fanfare. Make improvements and codify them into widely implemented best practices.
