**SI units (e.g. "Kilogram"), as opposed to Imperial ones (e.g. "pound")**

The International System of Units is the standard set of units used in most of the world (notably, not commonly used in the United States outside of scientific settings). It is a standard maintained by the "General Conference on Weights and Measures" (note: NOT the [[ISO]]).
