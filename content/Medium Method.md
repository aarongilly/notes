**A productivity technique combining both physical and digital media for their respective strengths.**

The Medium Method comes from the [[Todoist Productivity Articles]], I haven't really seen it anywhere else by that name. It's quite simple. 

# Use Physical Media Throughout the Day

Carry a pen and a notebook. Use post-its. [[Capturing Notes]]. [[Capturing Tasks]]. [[Capturing Logs]] Do general [[Ongoing Capture]] & [[Bullet Journaling]]. 

# Transcribe to Digital Each Night

Do a [[Daily Review]] each night in which you look over your notes from the day and process any actions or ideas into a digital repository. Offload tasks from the page to a [[Task Manager]]. Capture deadlines or appointments into your calendar. Add ideas worth developing to your [[Evergreen Notes]]. Send Tweets about whatever jokes you thought of.

## Benefits
- lack of distraction - notebooks don't have apps
- Active processing (not transcribing) causes you to remember more by writing less
- Free-form & fun
- Immediate [[Progressive Summarization]], [[Distillation|distilling]] fleeting thoughts and notes into a permanent system keeps cruft out.
