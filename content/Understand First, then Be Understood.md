**While interacting, priority is to understand the other person. Priority is to have your point understood.**

Habit 5 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood.

See other people's problems from their prospective. **Don't use active listening techniques in place of *actually listening (aka empathic listening)*.** We listen autobiographically, i.e. we put what we hear through our frame of reference, and it's not how we should listen.

When listening, **do not**:

- **Evaluate** (pass judgement)
- **Probe** (ask questions pertaining to our frame of reference)
- **Advise** (based on our frame of reference)
- **Interpret** (again based on our frame of reference)

Realize when you're using **your** frame of reference while listening, then stop and [[Empathy vs Sympathy|empathize]].

Don't listen only with the intent to reply. Also, when you do reply, be good at it. This is a bit of a "eat your cake and have it too" argument.
