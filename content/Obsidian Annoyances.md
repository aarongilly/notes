**[[Obsidian]] isn't perfect**

As much as I like Obsidian, there are some annoying things about it.

- [[Frontmatter]] isn't as usable as [[Notion]]'s page properties without database views
	- The [[Dataview plug-in]] MIGHT alleviate some of this, but has been too complicated thus far.
- I don't like the dichotomy of "Reading Mode" versus "Editing Mode". If I'm looking at [[my notes]] I want to be able to edit them. If I'm editing them I want them to look good.
- Really there's no way to set a Default Note template without a plugin?
- The editor on mobile pales in comparison to Notion's
	- Block-level manipulation would be great
	- The custom context menu next to text selection would be great
	- The "turn into" button from Notion is great.
- There is perhaps **too much** flexibility, the "right way" to do things or format things is prone to [[Analysis Paralysis]]
	- Eventually I (more or less) settled into a mode of operation & this doesn't bother me
- There's not a good way to have a "summary" of a note aside from just starting the note with an opening paragraph. The database view of my notes with their summary in Notion was great. I miss that. üôÅ
