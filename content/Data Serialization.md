**Formatting information for storage and transmission.**

Data Serialization is the act of translating a complex [[hierarchy]] (or blob) of information into a format where it can be stored and transmitted efficiently. Data Serialization is all about having [[Standard Processes]] for data organizations. These make it possible for tools and techniques to build on existing standards and work with one another (see: [[Standardization Enables Creativity]]).

There are a number of [[Data Serialization Methods]], [[JSON]], [[CSV]], [[XML]], and [[HTML]] being some of the more common ones. Some common features used in data serialization include:

- **Reserved characters** - a set of characters that have special meaning and use in a given serialization framework
    - Delimiters - what separates elements
    - Comments - a method of "breaking out" exposition about the data from the data itself
- **Escape characters** - a method to allow the use of otherwise reserved characters
    - Common example: `\`
- **Structure** - [[data serialization methods]] follow some form of underlying structure
