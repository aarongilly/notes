**The maximum rate of oxygen consumption per unit of time, a limit for how much energy you can expend through aerobic processes.**

VO2 Max (VO2MAX, or $VO_2 Max$ is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption per unit of time. It's the limit to how much energy you can expend through aerobic means. It's **not** what enables you to sprint at full speed for 30 seconds. It's what enables you to run a mile as fast as you can. It's related to the final stage of the [[3 Types of Energy Supply in Mammals]].

VO2 Max is a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality.

According to the [[Apple Health App]] (which cites its source, too) - these are the 'healthy' ranges:

### Measuring

Properly measuring VO2 Max involves a face mask and a treadmill. There are other means of testing it, but none of them are perfectly predictive and they all boil down to "how fast can you run over a many-minute period?".

It's measured in mL/(kg*min).

### Increasing

Do cardiovascular exercise that causes you to breath hard. Maintain that state as long as you can. Do that often.

A simple procedure per [[Outlive]] is to alternate between 4 minutes on and 4 minutes off of running very fast (but not sprinting) and letting your heart rate recover between sessions.
### Averages

Average healthy male is 35-40 mL/(kg * min). Female average is 27-31 mL/(kg * min). Training can raise this up to ~80 mL/(kg * min), if you're "elite".
