**Clean and Jerk, and the Snatch**

Olympic Weightlifting is a sport in which competitors try to out-lift each other in (primarily) two lifts:

1. [[Clean and Jerk]] 
2. [[Snatch]] 

When compared to [[Power Lifting]], Olympic Lifts require higher levels of explosiveness and coordination.

## Near-Olympic Lifts

While the [[Clean and Jerk]] and the [[Snatch]] are the two most common forms of Olympic Lifting, there are many other lifts that are commonly considered "Olympic Style". 

- [[Power Clean]]
- [[Push Press]]
- [[High Pulls]]
