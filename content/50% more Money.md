**Group experiments show that people "think" they'll have enough when they name 50% more, regardless of their earnings.**

In seminars held by Vicki Robin and her late co-author Joe Dominguez, audience members of all levels of income were asked to rate their happiness on a scale from 1 to 5. Then they were asked what level of income they thought would be [[Enough]]  to make them happy. They consistently said they would be happy if they had 50% more than they currently did... at every level. Even those who made 50% more than others in the audience didnâ€™t change their reported happiness in any significant way. This shows, beyond a basic threshold, ==there is no correlation between happiness and income==. The average rating for everyone, by the way, was ~2.6 - 2.8. Not even the 3 that would be an average from a normal distribution.

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ You will never achieve "more", but you can achieve [[Enough Money]].
