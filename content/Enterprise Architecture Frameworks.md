[[Enterprise Architecture]] Frameworks map the software & infrastructure development to how they relate to/fulfill the enterprise's mission. **Enterprise Architecture Frameworks are not modeling languages**, they may *use* modeling languages, but they are more related to the *views*, what they show, and perhaps process for creating them.

The three biggest ones as of 2024 are:
- [[UAF]] - Unified Architectural Framework
	- This ate up DODAF, MODAF, etc
	- It's an extension of [[SysML]]
- TOGAF - which is **not** the same thing as [[Archimate]], but may use it
	- Includes the Architecture Development Method (represented in the TOGAF circles graphic)
- Zachman, which answers "who/what/when/why/where/how" from the perspectives of the Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, Subcontractor, and User
