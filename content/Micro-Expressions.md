**Very short lived, minute facial expressions that are revealing and can be studied scientifically.**

There is a scientific study of faces. They have names and numbered and associated the activation of miracles along with associated feelings. Also the ability to cover up these natural reactions is not perfect. This gives rise to microexpressions, which are real and really do give away our inner feelings.
