There's this meme:
![[IMG_1176.jpeg]]
It's not always about notetaking, but all the best variations on the meme start and end the same way. The difference is that the dude on the left uses the obvious thing because it's obvious and easy, whereas the dude on the right uses the *simple* thing, because he's realized it does what he needs. 

Now in this case, that's crazy. Apple Notes is not doing what I've done here. **But** - it certainly can apply to my all-in on [[The Plain Text Life]]. [[My Notes]] are one case where I do feel like I'm actually in that rightmost standard deviation. 

Other areas come to mind:
### Tailwind 
When you're first learning [[HTML]], styling is most easily accomplished by in-lining your CSS styles. This got abstracted away to complicated CSS packages and languages built on top of them. You're chaining bootstrapping libraries (like bootstrap) alongside CSS processors. Eventually, Tailwind gained in popularity, despite the fact it is essentially just tooling for in-lining your CSS
### Bro Science
In high school, we basically just did the [[Big 6 Exercises]]. As I got older I started to think that exercise had to be some complicated thing. There's a ton of complicated programs you can follow... but you honestly can get your biggest bang for your buck by basically just sticking with the [[Unsexy Solutions]] that is the big 6.
### Fashion
I assume. I dunno.
