**Progressive Summarization works like ‘zoom’ levels for amount of detail desired.**

In his book Tiago Forte describes the various layers of [[Progressive Summarization]]  as functioning like a “zoom” on the content of the notes. You can zoom way out and only look at the bolder & highlighted phrases, or take some time to zoom in and read the context they're in and the rest of the note.
