**Continuing to spend resources on something not because it's still promising, but because you've already invested a lot.**

We have a tendency to continue to expend resources on bad bets just because we've already sunk a lot of resources into the endeavor. We have a bias towards continuing to path, no matter how flawed or non-optimal it is simply because that's where we *were* already going. 

This could be out of self-preservation, not wanting to admit that we were wrong. It could be a particular manifestation of [[Loss Aversion]]. Or it could be out of plain old stubbornness. 

While there is something to be said at not immediately throwing in the towel and maintaining [[focus]] even when new options become available, it should be a conscious, calculated choice to stay the course.
