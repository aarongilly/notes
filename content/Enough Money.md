**Your personal dollar figure.**

Know how much money is "[[Enough]]". This is a dollar figure that was described in [[Your Money or Your Life]] as "just enough money to cover your expenses, with a little something on top for fun". 

Frugal living is all about translating money into value, and only using it when the value is truly there. It's about knowing what is "enough" for you and making the fiscal choices to ensure it stays at that level.

Do not work tirelessly to provide for your family, only to realize after they've grown that you missed out on being with them because you were too busy working. Seek not more - seek [[Enough]]. Realize that you already have it.
