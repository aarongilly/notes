**UML lets you try to do too much and make it too complicated.**

One of the creators of [[UML]] has said that it’s “dead”. It got too complicated. The UML 2.0 Spec is >1000 pages long. 

Know *why* you’re using UML. Is your [[Modeling Purposes]] to create something simulatable? You probably shouldn’t. Instead make something that’s incomplete, but more clear. Effective communication is more important that exhaustive completion.
