If you’re doing something only because you want the result, that’s said to be “*just a means to your end*” - but it occurs to me the opposite case is also valid.

I have engaged in [[Project-Based Learning]] a number of times. Sometimes the result of the project wasn’t even all that interesting to me, but it was the motivation I needed to undertake the pursuit. One example was a calculator I built in [[React]], which wasn’t of any real use, but it gave my exploration into the React framework some *direction*. It focused what could have otherwise been aimless meandering. It caused me to find barriers *and* push through them. It was just **an end to my means**.

### Other examples:
- wanting to make a great Instagram album, because you want to do the things that it would take to do to make the album.
- creating a doodle on a new drawing app, or 3D modeling something in your room for no reason other than to learn CAD
