**A pattern for Separation of Concerns for UI Design**

MVC is Model, View, Controller.

The Model is the *data* model.
The View is the *presentation* logic.
The Controller is where most of the work happens, it sits between the other two and connects them.

In Udacity the Controller was also called the "Octopus".

The Controller provides [[Separation of Concerns]].
