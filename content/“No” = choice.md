**The ability to say no is the same as the ability to choose.**

If you take every opportunity that comes your way, if you jump at the first options that present themselves, then you are not choosing your path at all. You don’t have to do everything that someone asks you to do at work. If a meeting is not valuable, you can choose to say no.

> [!success] The ability to say “no” is the ability to choose.

You are given opportunities every day. Evaluate these opportunities against your values, goals, and priorities. If the opportunity doesn’t stand to benefit one of these essential aspects of your life, deny the opportunity.

> When you say 'no', you are only saying no to one option. When you say 'yes', you are saying no to every other option. No is a choice, yes is a responsibility.
