**When you have enough information - probably earlier than you think.**

When you stop getting new, **useful** information, make a call. It doesn’t need to be the globally “right” call most of the time. On time and good enough is better than ‘great, but late’.

Also bear in mind that the [[Optimum Level of Information]] is often lower than you’d think it is (or, even, what you *want* it to be). [[Action is Better than Research]].
