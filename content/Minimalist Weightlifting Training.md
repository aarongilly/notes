**Some tips from [[Pareto Analysis]] for hypertrophy**

Spending the least amount of time for the most amount of effect. Use the [[Pareto Principle]] to effect. 

1. Do **fewer sets** -> You don't even need to hit the [[~10-15 Sets Per Week]] to get most of the benefit
2. Push yourself harder -> Most sets should be taken **near failure**
3. Use **dropsets** -> Go to failure, drop by ~25-50% and take that to failure too
4. Use **supersets** -> On different muscle groups, not the same.
5. Do effective exercises -> [[Big 6 Exercises]]
