**Some tips from [[Pareto Analysis]] for hypertrophy**

Spending the least amount of time for the most amount of effect. Use the [[Pareto Principle]] to effect.

1. Push yourself harder -> Most sets should be taken near failure
2. Use dropsets -> Go to failure, drop by ~25-50% and take that to failure too
3. Use supersets -> On different muscle groups, not the same.
4. Do effective exercises -> [[Big 6 Exercises]]
