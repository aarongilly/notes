**If I didn't have this, how much would I give to get it?**

Minimalism questions - if the answer to either of these is "not much" - then it's not worth it:

1. If I didn't already own this, what would I spend to buy it right now?
2. If I didn't already have this opportunity, what would I do to earn it?
