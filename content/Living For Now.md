summary: If every moment is spent in pursuit of growth or making some imagined future "better", you'll never live for now.

Pursuit of goals and betterness is not inherently good or bad. It is important, though, to realize that **you probably already *have* achieved "betterness" and that there's always "more better" for you to aspire to**. You'll never get there. You have perhaps already made it to where you once aspired to be, but the goalposts have shifted all along the way. [[Feeling "On Top" of Life]] is impossible. 

> [!tldr] Do what you can and be happy with what you can do! It is [[Enough]].

**You have to love some moments for what they are, not for the sake of some future imagined moments**. In fact most of your moments should probably be this way. It doesn't mean you shouldn't plan for and work for a better tomorrow, but you **should enjoy the work today - because you won't enjoy tomorrow if tomorrow you're too busy worrying about the next day**.
