**Six basic types of information per Robert Horn.**

Robert Horn, the father of [[Information Mapping]], suggested that there's 6 fundamental types of information that cover nearly all needs for technical and business communications.

1. **Procedure** - a set of steps to accomplish a task
2. **Process** - a series of events, stages, or phases that result in a specific outcome
3. **Principle** - a statement that dictates or guides behavior
4. **Concept** - a class of things that share a critical set of attributes
5. **Structure** - a description of anything that has parts or boundaries
6. **Fact** - a statement that's assumed to be true
