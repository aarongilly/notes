**SysML equivalent of Class Diagrams**

Block Definition Diagrams (BDDs) are essentially exactly the same as [[Class Diagrams]]. But, rather than Classes (a software-specific term), BDDs represent [[SysML Blocks]]. They represent the kinds of things that can exist, but not individual instances of those things. They include attributes (see: [[SysML Block Property Types]]) like how Class Diagrams have properties, and they include behaviors that entities can exhibit, like methods in Class Diagrams.

Block Definition diagrams can also include things like **constraints**, which may impose rules about valid configurations of block instances; and **ports** which are places/interfaces wherein interactions may occur.
