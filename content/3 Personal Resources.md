**Time, Energy, & Money**

There are 3 widely agreed upon resources that each person has to manage. Be aware of how you're managing your time, energy, and money.

The area of this triangle varies for each of us, but is not infinite.

## Time

You only get so much, and if you're lucky you don't know how much more you'll get.

## Energy

Nobody has an infinite supply of energy. What you give your energy to is just as important as the other 3. 

## Money

Most people have a limited supply of money. Having it doesn't solve all of life's problems, but not having it create more of them. 

The management of these resources is what I call [[Personal Economics]].
