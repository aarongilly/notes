**An import concept in [[Public Key Encryption]]**

Primitive Root is a thing one number can be of another number. This deals with [[Prime Numbers]] and [[Modular Arithmetic]]. When used in the context of [[Public Key Encryption]], the Primitive Root of the Modular operation is called the '**generator**'.

The definition of "primitive root" is a bit to opaque for me to glean without the examples below, but it's:
> A primitive root mod n isÂ **an integer g such that every integer [[Relatively Prime]] to n is congruent to a power of g mod n**.

This makes a lot more sense in the examples below, from the source video:

2 is a primitive root of 5 because 2^1 mod 5 all the way through 2^(5-1) mod 5 give **unique values**.

Same can be said for 3 is a primitive root of 7:

And, to show that not all primes are primitive roots of each other - 2 is NOT a primitive root of 7:

## So what

With a Primitive Root, you get a uniform distribution when raising the "**generator**" to any integer power (X) modulus the prime number.

Given the congruent result, finding the exponent is computationally *hard* to do. It is a [[One-Way Function]]:
