**[[Less, but Better]]**

**Essentialism** is a term coined by the author of a book of the same name, Greg McKeown, to refer to the practice general practice of doing **less, but better**. The concept is the theme of the book. Essentialism is about finding clarity, knowing what's important, and putting your energy toward that.

Those who practice essentialism are *essentialists*. 

With the benefit of some hindsight, the term is a bit cringey.
