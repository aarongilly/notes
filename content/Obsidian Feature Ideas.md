Not a standard type of note, but whatever.
## Obvious Stuff
For completeness - here's the obvious list:
- Default note templates
	- Assignable per folder, for a bonus
- Canvas promotion to be a 1st class citizen
	- Search indexing, backlinks
	- Included in obsidian’s “Publish”
## Typed Links Graph
Basically just see [[Obsidian as a Semantic Wiki]]. 
## Note Hero Images/Icons
Basically just ripoff [[Notion]] here, but I do think it would be useful to be able to associate some form of graphic to a note as an alternative to its title. Basically create a **Visual Alias**. This would make the [[Obsidian Canvas]] and Link Graphs (and my idea below) more interesting.
## Venn Diagramming
For notes that use [[Frontmatter]] sharing a common [[Primary Key]], plot them out using a Venn Diagram about that key's value. It would be even better if you could **add** that key & assign its value *using* the Venn. This is like a more versatile version of the [[Kanban]] plug-in for [[Obsidian]]. Something that allows for multiple assignments (which would manifest as a list on that property).
### Variant - Different Keys
I suppose the Venn wouldn't NEED to be the same key. Could just have groups based on any arbitrary key. This would be even more versatile.
