**Progressive Summarization makes your notes less, but better.**

Quote from the book connects progressive summarization with the “[[Less, but Better]]” mantra:

> Progressive summarization is not a method for remembering it as much as possible – it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly.
> 

Distillation is meant to make it easy to find and work with our notes in the future, to make ideas small and compact, so we can load them into our mind with minimal effort.
