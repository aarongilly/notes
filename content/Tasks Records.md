**`= this.summary`**

I don't think tasks need to be retained. Simple "tasks" are, by definition, not important enough to warrant being saved for forever. Instead of "completing" tasks in task managers that save data, perhaps you should be **deleting** tasks. Obviously there are some exceptions but you'll know about those in advance and those are typically parts of a project.
