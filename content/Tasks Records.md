summary: Tasks don't need to be saved in perpetuity.

I don't think tasks need to be retained. Simple "tasks" are, by definition, not important enough to warrant [[Saving For Perpetuity]]. Instead of "completing" tasks in task managers that save data, perhaps you should be **deleting** tasks. Obviously there are some exceptions but you'll know about those in advance and those are typically parts of a project.
