# GPS Satellites are Clocks
GPS Satellites are just clocks. They are in known locations and they repeatedly send out very precise measurements of the time according to their on-board clock. GPS receivers like your phone read those times from at least 3 satellites and use the differences in the received time to determine path lengths to the satellites and triangulate their position.
