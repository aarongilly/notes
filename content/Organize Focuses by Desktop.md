**`= this.summary`**

Traditional window-supporting computers are subject to [[Clutter]]. When you switch tasks, but want to leave open the materials you were working on to come back to them later, then end up lingering in your peripheral vision. They dilute what you're trying to [[Focus]] on, and make [[Productive Distraction]] too easy to slip into. 

Mac, Windows, and most Linux distos use a "virtual desktop" system. This allows you to keep things open, but to keep things that aren't relevant out of your line of sight. You can assign one desktop per [[Defining Project|project]]. This helps you [[Know Your Immediate Task]], focus on [[What's Important Now]], and relieves [[Continuous Partial Attention]].

When you *do* switch, it is more intentional. It's more like a full context switch.
