**If you are not selective about the actions you accept, you’ll spend 80% of your time on 20% value.**

Most people spend their time at work bouncing back and forth between managing their email, editing presentations, tweaking data, and dealing with ad hoc requests from their bosses or coworkers. People like this are **majoring in minor work**. They are busy, but not productive. They are not likely to see progress in the things they care about. They are not likely to be suited with their job. 

> [!tldr] ⛔ Nobody wants “he answered email” written in their obituary.
