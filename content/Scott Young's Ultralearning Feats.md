The author of ultralearning got inspiration from a guy who claimed to learn languages in three months by total immersion and aggressive, self learning. The author took his friend on a year-long trip to four different countries, and both of them succeeded in learning four new languages, one every 3 months, by refusing to speak English the entire time.

Before writing [[Ultralearning]], Scott Young...
- Completed a Harvard CS degree (including all tests and assignments) in 12 months.
- Learned 4 languages in a year through total immersion
- Taught himself to draw realistic portraits in a month
