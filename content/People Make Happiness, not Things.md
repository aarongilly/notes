**People are happier when they have better *relationships*, not better things.**

Family and community have (evidentially) more impact on our happiness (as measured) than money and health, once you hit a minimal threshold.

Subjective ratings of happiness are only more consistently high for those people who have good relationships. Those people with riches and material wealth donâ€™t really report measurably higher happiness than those with near average wealth.

In [[The Little Book of Hygge]] this principle is used as evidence of the importance of sharing "Hygge" with other people.
