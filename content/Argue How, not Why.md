**When arguing against a position, ask the opponent how their side works - get into the details.**

When arguing for or against a position, focusing on how your position works and asking them about how their position works. Make them think through what they know of their own position. Hammering on why you're right, especially with a "defend/attack" cycle doesn't move the debate anywhere.
