When it comes to affecting the performance of a system, these are the places to try to exert your resources.

12. **Tweak the Numbers** - change constants & parameters (subsidies, taxes, etc)
11. **Buffers** - change the size of stabilizing stocks 
10. **Stock & Flow Structures** - change how physical system nodes intersect
9. **Delays** - change the length of times for behaviors relative to system changes
8. **Balancing Feedback Loops** - change the strength of feedback loops relative to the behaviors they moderate.
7. **Reinforcing Feedback Loops** - change the strength of gain-inducing loops.
6. **Information Flows** - Change who does and doesn't have access to info.
5. **Rules** - Create incentives, punishments, constraints
4. **Self-Organization** - Allow the system to to change its own structure.
3. **Goals** - address the purpose of the system
2. **Paradigms** - change the mindset in which the system operates, its goals, structure, rewrite the rules 
1. **Transcending Paradigms** - dunno. The source didn't explain this enough
