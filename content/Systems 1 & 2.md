**We think in two modes**

Humans have two basic modes of thought:

## [[System 1]]

System one operates automatically. Doing fast calculations and quick judgments. System one is imperfect. [[Snap Judgments]] are from System 1.

## [[System 2]]

System two is calculating, but fundamentally lazy. Following [[Checklists]] or procedures requires engaging system 2.

Each mode has its purpose, its strengths, and its weaknesses. See their respective notes.
