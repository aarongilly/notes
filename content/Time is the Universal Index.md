**`= this.summary`**

When you're looking to index things, *when* they took place is a **pretty good** mechanism. Time is the index that runs the universe. We're moving through it at a rate of one second per second.

Note: Time *zones* can make software messy. If you're going to treat time as an index (e.g. as a [[Primary Key]] or part of a [[Composite Key]]), you need to figure out a timezone handling strategy.
