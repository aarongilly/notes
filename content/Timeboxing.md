**Set how long you'll work on a task. Work on it only that long. Time blocking with a deadline.**

Timeboxing is essentially [[Time Blocking]], but where you further stipulate that the chunk of scope you're dedicating a block of time to **WILL BE DONE** by the end of that block. This ensures that you're focused, distraction-free, on the task at hand, AND that you won't let effort on any given task crowd into time you'd previously planned to use for other work.

A Timeboxed schedule is what Cal Newport (author of [[Deep Work]]) credits for his ability to get so much done in a week.

## Why

The purpose of this is to combat perfectionism. It is a form of applying the [[Pareto Principle]] to achieve the vast majority of what needs to get done in the minimum amount of time.
