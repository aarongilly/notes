**Databases that aren't just tables. There are several varieties. **

Non-relational databases are databases that aren't simple tables of consistent rows and columns like you'd find in [[Relational Databases]]. Some domains lend themselves to relational schemas very well, others not so much. For those cases where non-relational data isn't well suited, some type of non-relational database is probably a better fit. Any given problem may be suited best by any of the various [[Types of Non-relational Databases]]
