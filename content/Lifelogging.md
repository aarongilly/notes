**A movement in measurement.**

Lifelogging is the act of recording and tracing artifacts from one's real-life events. It's also known as self-tracking and the "quantified self".

"LifeLog" was a DARPA Project from 2003 to 2004. It had the goal of being able to analyze ones experiences to make better predictions about future behavior.
