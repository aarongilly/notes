"Rule Beating" is a term used to describe behaviors in which agents subject to a rule find ways to comply with the letter of the rule, regardless of the *intent* or "spirit" of the rule. 

Examples:
- Spending budgets frivolously at the end of the year so you can claim having achieved accuracy in your forecast. ([[Gaming KPIs]])
- Protections of land on which endangered species natively lived, leading to some folks, having discovered the endangered species on their land choosing to *kill the endangered animal* rather than have their land be subject to the protections.

Rule beating may be done out of spite, or could possibly just be done out of apathy. Either way, it's a sign of an ineffective policy and probably contributing to some form of [[Waste]]. 

Rule beating behavior is a signal that the rules are *not ideal* in some form (be them overly restrictive, vague, outdated, or bad [[Proxy Measures]]).
