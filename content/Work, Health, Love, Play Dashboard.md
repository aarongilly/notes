**A subjective dashboard to keep yourself balanced.**

Make a dashboard in which you subjectively rate how full your gages are in work satisfaction, health according to your definition, love according to your definition, and play (what you do just for fun, not to win or to get it done). Keep these four large areas of your life in balance and dedicate them each appropriate (and only appropriate) energy levels.
