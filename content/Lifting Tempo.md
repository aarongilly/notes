Muscle growth probably happens more on the "down" (eccentric) portion of the motion than the "up" (concentric) portion. A good "body building tempo" to aim for is something like ~3 seconds down, ~1 second up.

In practice this has seemed to yield noticeable results. Or maybe itâ€™s wishful thinking.
