**It takes longer to keep messages (& code) short**

The quote below is often attributed to Mark Twain but  it's actually from the namesake of the unit of pressure: Blaise Pascal. One thing that I have learned through painful experience is that it applies, doubly when it comes to code.

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time. *- Blaise Pascal*

I have learned through multiple successive refactors of the [[PDW]] that it takes time to write less code. My codebase goes through pretty significant expansion and contraction cycles. I suspect the case is true for modeling, too.
