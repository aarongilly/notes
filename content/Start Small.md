**It doesn't work to try to do everything up front**

When designing a system or solving a huge problem, it's almost always better to start small. Pick some well-representative portion of the problem, try to solve it. Learn from that process. Make small mistakes that are easier to fix. After your solution works, then expand it or generalize it to encompass more of the whole.

This motto can also be applied to breaking down [[Defining Project|project]]s, trying to [[GTD|Get Things Done]], or do a task you're avoiding [[2 Minute Rule of Habits]].
