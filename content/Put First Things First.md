Habit 3 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Put First Things First.

> [!tldr] ⚠️ The things that matter most must never be at the mercy of the things that matter least.

There’s a difference between important and urgent. Don’t neglect that which is important but not urgent. Avoid the unimportant altogether. 

Stephen assigns numbers to the 4 quadrants of [[The Eisenhower Square]]. 

Most of *"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"* is centered on quadrant two. That's where a lot of PC work lives ([[P-PC Balance]]).
