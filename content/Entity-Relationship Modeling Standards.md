**IDEF1X, UML, Crows Feet, etc **

There are a number of standards for creating representations for [[Entity-Relationship Model]]  that can be used to diagram an ER model, such as IDEF1X (IDEF Overview), UML, Bachman Notation, Martin (a.k.a. "Crows Feet"), and others. 

Also the [[Block Definition Diagram ]] from [[SysML]].
