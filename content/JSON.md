**[[JavaScript]] Object Notation - the internet's favorite data storage solution.**

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, tree-structured data storage format with support for lists of key-value pairs (aka "[[maps]]"), arrays, and infinite nesting. It's the de facto data storage and transmission standard of the internet. It's widely used and most modern development languages handle JSON natively. 

## Benefits over .CSV

- Parsing errors are very infrequent
- Parsing is handled natively in many programming languages
- You can represent much more diverse data with a much higher density when compared to .CSV

## Drawbacks Compared to .CSV

- JSON takes some level of learning to "pick up". It's not as simple as relational data.
- Cannot just open a .JSON file in Excel

## Limitations

- You cannot have an object that contains a reference to itself
