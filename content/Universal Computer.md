**It's quite possible the universe is a computer.**

The universe could very well be a computer. You can think of the raw materials as the hardware, their interactions according to physics are the software. Biological life and everything we do are abstractions built upon that software. If there's a minimum, Planck-length indivisible unit of being (from string theory), the universe is made up of these units. Therefore a large enough vector could be used to encode the entire universe. A few simple laws of physics could be introduced into that code as algorithms, and we'd suddenly find ourselves in a simulated universe. So maybe we already are?
