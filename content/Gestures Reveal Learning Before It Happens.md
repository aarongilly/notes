A really interesting study found that a significant portion of people trying to explain a topic about which they were learning went through a phase wherein **the *gestures* they made demonstrated learning before they were able to articulate it**. The percentage was something like 30% of folks who demonstrated this progression:

1. Gestures and words were [[Congruent]], and both wrong
2. Gestures and words no longer matched, the gestures were demonstrating new concepts that the words couldn't express
3. Gestures and words regained congruency, and both were right

This is a hint that your [[Proprioception]] may be unconsciously "ahead" of where the verbal [[Central Executive]] is.
