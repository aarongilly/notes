**The number of arguments to a function.**

"Arity" is the number of arguments to a function, as used in the realm of mathematics and software engineering. Arity is useful for determining the complexity of a function. A reduction in arity with minimal impact is the goal of [[Pareto Analysis]].

Note Arity is not the same term as "[[Cardinality]]", although they are very similar. It seems that "arity" is a more specific term referring to the cardinality of *inputs* to a given function. That's a common enough consideration that it grew an independent name that we call "arity".

## Examples

- f(x,y,z) has an arity of "3".
- "Distance travelled" of a flying object is primarily a function of velocity, azimuth, and drag. This is also an arity of 3.
