**Be genuinely you and do good work not in a vacuum and you'll wind up having a network.**

"Networking" for the sake of intentionally expanding your network is not a great practice. It creates surface-level relationships at best, it creates toxic relationships at worst. By "Networking" you're looking to build an army of people you can *use* to do whatever you can with.

On the other hand, *having* a network is a great thing. Networks of genuine connections can be both personally fulfilling and incredibly useful from a work perspective. The best way to "network" is to be genuine and true to who you are, to do good work, to get to know the people who relate to the things you do.
