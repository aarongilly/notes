**.txt, .csv, .ods, .pdf, .mp4, .flac, .tif**

Not all file types are created equal. In terms of resistance to going out-of-support, or file type corruptions, these are the kings:

- Documents
    - .txt - king, use [[UTF-8]] character encoding
        - Any offshoot of text that is just text under the hood (like [[Markdown]]
    - .pdf
    - .odt
    - .docx ← "x" at the end is important, it's [[XML]]-based
- Spreadsheets
    - .csv - king (see: [[CSV]])
    - .ods
    - .xlsx ← "x" at the end is important, it's [[XML]]-based
- Presentations
    - .pptx ← "x" at the end is important, it's [[XML]]-based
- Images
    - .raw - lossless, large
    - .tif - lossless, large
    - .jpg
    - .png
    - ...or use PDFs
- Video
    - .mp4
- Audio
    - .flac - lossless, large
    - .mp3
