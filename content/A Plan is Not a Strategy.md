**Strategies direct plans, make them coherent.**

A plan is not the same thing as a [[What is a Strategy|strategy]]. Everyone plans, not everyone has a strategy. Strategies are what gives coherence to your plans.

See:
- [[What is a Plan]]
- [[What is a Strategy]]

## Avoiding the Planning Trap
To avoid "playing just to play" and actually act according to a *strategy*:
- Accept angst. You'll never know for sure a strategy will work
- Lay out the logic. Then tweak as necessary.
- Write a [[Strategy Document]]

## Example of a Strategy
- Southwest Airlines decided they would get more customers by being the cheapest airline by: minimizing plane-on-ground time, using a point-to-point model, not offering in-flight meals & specializing in short-to-medium flights, not book though travel agents, and only buying one type of plane
	- Where we're playing: short-haul airline travel
	- How we're choosing to win: minimize costs to consumer
	- The capabilities we need: rapid plane turnover, direct-to-consumer ticketing
