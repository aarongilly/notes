**Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1**

2 and 9 **are** relatively prime. Because they share no common factors:
- 2: factors `[1, 2]`
- 9: factors `[1, 3, 9]`
No number other than "1" is shared. Therefore they are, by definition, *relatively prime*.

9 and 27 are **not** relatively prime, because their [[Greatest Common Factor]] is > 1 (it's 3).
