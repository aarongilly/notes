**Picturing the worst thing that could possibly happen to something that brings you joy.**

There's a relatively common behavior in the human experience - just as things are going really well, you start to panic. You picture the worst thing that could possibly happen. You image what it would be like. 

Foreboding joy is one of the [[Vulnerability Shields]]. People who say they do this often say they do it because they want to "be prepared". But, those who have pictured the worst thing, then actually been unfortunate enough to *experience* it always say that "imagining it didn't help".

If you're foreboding joy brings you stress and prevents you from enjoying what you have, you shouldn't be doing it. If, however, you're doing it to heighten your appreciation for what you have, go for it.
