**No buffer = no choice.**

Have a buffer. Create space between things. Create time in advance. Without space, you'll eventually be forced into cramming. Your alternative options will go to zero. You won't be able to tolerate slowdowns or unexpected headwinds. You'll encounter more stress as you suddenly need to fight that which may not be made to go faster or else be late to something else.

Front load work. They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure - well the same thing goes for planning and preliminary work. Do 10 minutes now to test an approach, you have the chance to realize the approach is flawed, and the time to find something better. 

Don’t fall victim to the [[Planning Fallacy]]. Prepare prepare prepare. Add 50% to your time estimates. You won’t be any better than anyone else at predicting the future. So allow resources for it.
