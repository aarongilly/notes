**LEAN is to Manufacturing what Agile is to Software Development.**

"Agile" is a term for an approach to software development in which decisions are not pre-ordained and orchestrated well in advance by some presiding authority at the behest of a well-understood, vetted & complete set of requirements, but *instead* decisions are made by those closest to the problems that are being solved. Rapid prototypes are generated by the coders in response to users needs, those prototypes are demonstrated. The [[Feedback Loop]] is shortened and as a result the team and the product they are creating is, in fact, more agile.

Agile programming focuses on short timeframes and smaller deliverables. Itâ€™s a high-frequency delivery of [[Minimum Viable Progress]] as dictated by the customer.
