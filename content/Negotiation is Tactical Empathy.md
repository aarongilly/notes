**Negotiation is about feelings, not logic.**

Top schools taught a very ‘academic’ approach to negotiation. It was grounded in problem solving, as detailed in a book called “Getting to Yes”, you are supposed to:

1. Separate the people from the problem
2. focus on ‘why’ a person is asking for something rather than what they are asking for
3. generate a variety of options before settling on an agreement
4. come up with agreed to objective criteria for both parties to feel win-win

This problem-solving approach to negotiation **didn’t hold up to a very practical**, real-world test against Chris Voss, the author of ‘Never Split the Difference’, who’s technique he described as “tactical empathy”. It had much more to do with feelings than to do with problem solving.
