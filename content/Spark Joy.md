**Marie Kondo's key to tidying & overall happiness**

Marie Kondo, author of [[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up]], set off a trend of branded minimalism all about the phrase "spark joy". Basically, anything that you own should "spark joy in your heart" when you touch it. If something you own doesn't do that, you shouldn't own it.
