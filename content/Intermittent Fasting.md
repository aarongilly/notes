**Timing consumption of calories.**

Intermittent fasting has come up time and time again in many sources as a good idea. The basic premise is to avoid eating calories for some duration of time on a routine basis. There are a variety of methods, a variety of purported benefits, and a variety of proposed underlying mechanisms for how those benefits are achieved. Doing intermittent fasting would also lower the number of meals you have to prepare and clean up. It’s an example of [[Less, but Better]].

Methods:

- Just skip breakfast & don't snack
- Don’t eat when the sun isn’t shining
- Only eat from noon to 8pm
- Don’t eat on Wednesdays

Benefits:

- Weight control
- Discipline
- Hormonal stabilization

Mechanisms:

- “We weren’t evolved to eat tiny little meals constantly”
- “It’s simply a reduction of total calories”
