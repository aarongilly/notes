**Minimalism is about having and doing less, but better.**

**Minimalism is not about “having less”, it’s about “enjoying more”.** It Is not restricted to possessions, a minimalist philosophy can be applied to activities and relationships.

Minimalism is **addition through subtraction**. By cutting out the stuff that you don’t truly love, you make more room for those things, people, and activities that you do love. It gives you clarity and the space to use that clarity.
