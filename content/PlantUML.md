**A slightly older cousin of Mermaid for drawing Diagrams using Code.**

PlantUML is a Diagrams as Code platform for drawing 20+ kinds of diagrams using fairly simple, fairly intuitive (although, arguably less intuitive than [[Mermaid]]) syntax. See [[PlantUML vs Mermaid]] for more on that.

PlantUML was built primarily for use *locally* - its documentation starts with information about how to install PlantUML locally, but has been adapted into at least one web-based application:

[PlantUML Web Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000)

### Example Syntax

```
@startuml
Bob -> Alice : hello
Alice -> Bob : oh hi.
Bob -> Charlie : I was talking with you.
Charlie -> Alice : Sorry, he's just like that
Alice -> Alice : I guess I'll go
@enduml
```
