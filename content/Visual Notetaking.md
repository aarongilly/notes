**`= this.summary`**

Visual Notetaking is popular online, especially in [[Bullet Journaling]] circles. There are (many) whole YouTube channels whose videos are essentially just drawing out lessons from books.

It's popular because it makes aesthetically pleasing results.

It *should* be popular because **it forces you to actually *engage* with the content of the material** in order to figure out how to best present it.

Writing a ton of words doesn't produce better learning than doing the work of [[Distillation]]. Pretty designs and straight lines are just dessert. Nice, but not the point of the meal.
