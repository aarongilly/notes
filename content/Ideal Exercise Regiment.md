**No "global" ideal regiment exists, but there are many that are "good enough" for most cases.**

There is no single "global" recommendation that can be made for what amounts of what types of exercises should be taken by *everyone*, because everyone's **goals** and needs are different. That said, you could do worse than the basic recommendations made by our government. [[Huberman's Foundational Fitness Routine]] covers all these bases. This will put you in a position to be [[Health is Vague|healthy]] and maximize your [[Healthspan vs Lifespan|healthspan]]. 

- Adults should **move more and sit less throughout the day.** Avoid [[Chronic Inactivity]]. Some physical activity is better than none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous[^1] physical activity gain some health benefits.
- For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least:
    - **150 minutes** to 300 minutes a week of **moderate-intensity** aerobic physical activity (50% - 70% max HR)
    - or **75 minutes** to 150 minutes a week of **vigorous-intensity aerobic** physical activity (70% - 85% max HR)
    - or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.
- Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread **throughout the week.**
- Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of *300 minutes* of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.
	- This is an hour a day during the week, a great routine if you can manage it.
- Adults should also do **muscle-strengthening activities** of moderate or greater intensity and that involve **all major muscle groups** on **2 or more days a week**, as these activities provide additional health benefit. 

> [!tldr]+ ðŸ’“ TL;DR
> Strength train 2+ times/week & do cardio at various levels of intensity such that youâ€™re at:
> - 75 minutes at 130-160bpm
> - 150 minutes at 90-130bpm

Based on [[Heart Rate Zones]] of a ~33 year old.

[^1]: For the terms "moderate" and "vigorous" it would seem logical to use the appropriate translation in [[Heart Rate Zones]]
