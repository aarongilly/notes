A weirdly-placed app in Apple's lineup, the Reminders App is really pretty alright. It excels at some things, has some surprising power user features, but also lacks some pretty basic ones.

You used Reminders as your to-do app pretty successfully for over a year, o my giving it up when you figured out how to make [[Notion]] similarly capable using Google Apps Script as a middleware. Reminders wasn't capable enough of being a [[Project Management App]]. 

## Good At
- Being an [[Inbox]] - getting things in easily
	- Integration with Siri is great
- [[Contextual Reminders]] - time & location based, messaging based too 

## Bad At
- Project Management - not great
- Cannot see timed reminders on your calendar, which is dumb
- The native widget is bad.
- "Lists" in reminders are treated both like [[Defining Area|area]]s and [[Project Lists]], and it's too many taps to move things from the inbox to a list from the phone
