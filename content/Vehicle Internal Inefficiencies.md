**Between engine output and the wheels cars lose an estimated 15% of their power on average. Electric vehicles do better.**

In addition to [[I.C. Engines Efficiencies]] not being great, a standard (non-electric) vehicle loses about **15%** of the energy output by its engine to internal resistance by the time that energy makes it to the tires on the road.

I saw this figure in several places. The first listed out the losses at major components piece by piece (Driveshaft, Differential, Propeller Shaft, Gearbox, and gear mesh).

## Electric are Better

Electric vehicles are much less complicate. Less going on â‡’ less losses in all that stuff. This is a Tesla Model S drivetrain.
