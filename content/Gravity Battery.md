**Using excess energy production to lift a heavy object, then lowering that object when production is low to keep energy levels high.**

“Gravity Batteries” are an idea wherein energy is stored as **gravitational** potential energy. 

A gravity battery uses excess energy production to lift a heavy object, then lowering that object when production is low to keep energy levels high. This could be concrete blocks, rocks, garbage in a box, or, most common of all - water. Pumping water back up from the low side to the high side of a hydroelectric dam is a viable form of gravity batteries.

There are startup companies that want to make large-scale gravitational batteries for deployment alongside generation stations. This technology may never take off.

## Pros

- Solves the problem that [[Energy Generation is Bursty]]
- Doesn’t involve mining chemicals and producing batteries, which are hard to recycle

## Cons

- Gravitational batteries have a poor [[Energy Density]].
    - Gravitational potential energy of a 5 gallon bucket full of water, 30 feet in the air: 
    0.00047 kWh
        
        Taking into account the [[Average Energy Cost]] - that’s $0.00007
        
    - A 55 gallon barrel on your roof is approximately the same as a AA battery
- Making concrete isn’t great for the environment.
