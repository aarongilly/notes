**`= this.summary`**

The term "Evergreen Notes" is used by [[Andy Matuschak]] to refer to a similar but slightly different form of note taking from the classic [[Zettelkasten Components|Zettelkasten]] and [[Atomic Notes]]. These are [[Intermediate Packets]] that are built for their own purpose. They are both self-contained and linked out to other self-contained units. The context arises naturally.

Andy's style is to title most notes with a complete thought, as opposed to a simple subject. I like this approach. Mine here are more like Wikipedia article titles. I may start to  [[[[Use Full Sentence Note Titles to Crystalize Thought]].
