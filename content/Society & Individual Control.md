**Societal controls keep individual biological imperatives in check.**

Society controls its members to ensure the benefit of the whole. The individual who doesn't control their biological desires somewhat will not make for a happy individual. They'll end up in jail or just continually frustrated that they can't eat everything in the candy aisle or sleep with whoever whenever, regardless of how that person feels. Societal controls use these built-in biological imperatives as the arms of their control. They restrict your ability to pursue pleasures, or in some places inflict physical pain.
