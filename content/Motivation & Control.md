**Humans have an intrinsic need for control, it's motivating.**

"The need for control is a biological imperative". We have an instinct for control. Control is motivating. As a matter of fact **it doesn't even really matter what we are controlling** - or if controlling means we aren't any better off. This is why you take the exit off the slow highway even though the back roads are longer.

[[All Motivation is the Desire to Escape Discomfort]]. 

The biological seat of motivation is the striatum, a part of your lizard brain. Damage to the striatum can cause a complete and utter loss of motivation and the ability to make decisions. 

There are medical cases of a complete and utter loss of motivation. People would become suddenly passive. Not sad. Not dealing with memory loss or change in intelligence. This comes from damage to the striatum. Very small damage can result in total apathy. They don't care to move on their own, but CAN move.
