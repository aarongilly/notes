**Application to hold Open Action Lists and surface Contextual Reminders.**

You need a task manager. Ideally one covering the features below. See the options below that. Most task managers have essentially the same set of features.

## Features

- Mobility - availability where ever
- [[Contextual Reminders]] for time and location
- Organization of tasks into lists ([[Project Lists]])
- Synchronicity between clients
- Application of tags for Filtering by context
    - Tag by Location, timespan, person, or available tools

## Options

This list will inevitably go out of date. Iâ€™m used Todoist, lately it's been Notion. It's got no compromises.

- Todoist
- Outlook
- Wunderlist
- Things 3 on iOS
- [[Notion]] can work
- Google Tasks
- Google Keep
