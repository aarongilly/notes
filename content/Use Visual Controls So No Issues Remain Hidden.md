Visual Controls make it obvious if something is trending south. They're a part of [[Toyota's 14 Principles]] and, thus, [[Six Sigma]] and [[LEAN Manufacturing]]. They increase [[Goal Presence]] and increase [[focus]] on achieving results (assuming you're using [[Good Metrics]]). Wherever possible, it's advisable to utilize visual controls. Prefer systems that enable them. 

## Example Visual Controls
- Burn down (or "burn up") charts
- Dashboards with clear results and clear inputs to what's driving them
- Color coding things
- [[Andon Light]]s - a clear un-missable place to raise alarms for flagging problems
- [[Kanban]]
- [[Gantt Charts]]
- [[Daily Post It]] & displaying the [[3 Goals a Day]]
- Quality standards - a "good example" to reference
