There's only 168 hours in a week. What you do with them, consistently, is what defines your life. [[You Are Time]]. It's definitely worth thinking about (and, from time to time, tracking) how you spend your 168 hours. 

## An Ideal(ish) Week
Base 168
- **Sleep**: 7 * 8 = 56 (don't do less, [[Protect Sleep]])
Remaining: 112
- **Work**: 40 +  8 (commute) = 48 (~30% of your life, figure out how to enjoy it)
Remaining: 64 
* **Chores**: 1.5 hrs/day = 11 ([[Love the Process]])
Remaining: 53
- **Exercise**: ~1 hr/day = 7 ([[Ideal Exercise Regiment]]) 
Remaining: 46
* **Family**: 3 hr/day = 21 
Remaining: 25
* **Hobbies**: 1 hr/day = 7 ([[Have Hobbies]])
Remaining: 18
* **Everything Else**

Even after spending "appropriate" amounts of time on all the things, you still have essentially *a full day per week* of extra time. As Arnold Schwarzenegger said:
