> [!tldr] chest, arms, shoulders, back, core, legs

Like the [[Facets of Fitness]], it's not always obvious what people mean when they talk about major muscle groups. Sometimes calves are included with legs, sometimes they are separate. Sometimes the abs are called out, other times, they are lumped in with the core. 
A cross section of sources:
- chest
- back
- arms
- abdominals/core
- legs/calves
- shoulders
