**Good relationships with others make life worth living and keep a brain youthful.**

The key to a long, happy, and healthy life lay with the quality of your relationships you have. The people you know you can truly rely on to go to when the going gets tough. The people you turn to at those times. People who have good, close relationships with others are much less likely to develop dementia than those who are alone.
