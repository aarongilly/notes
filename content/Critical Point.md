**A point on a curve where the slope = 0**

A critical point is usually a local (or global) maxima or minima of a function. It is possible, though, such as in the case of x^3, that a critical point is neither a maxima or minima.

Can be found by taking the [[Derivative]] of the function, then finding where the result is equal to zero.
$$\frac{d}{dx} x^2 + 1 = 2x$$
2x = 0 @ x=0... so x=0 is a Critical Point. In this case, it's also a local and global minima.
