summary: Some tips for resetting yourself when progress feels horribly fleeting despite large effort.
---
You can reset your goal when progress is not happening, or not happening quickly enough. 

Goals should be:
- Soon - not requiring patience 
- Certain - within your control
- Positive - not avoiding something bad, but getting something good
- Measurable - you can truly said "I did the thing"
- Specific - the more specific the easier it is to celebrate having done *that thing*
- Personal - when possible, reframe your effort as being done in service of someone you like, someone *specific*
