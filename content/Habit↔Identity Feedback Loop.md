**Your habits shape your identity. Your identity shapes your habits.**

Your habits shape your identity. Your identity shapes your habits.

Goals set up a pattern of differed happiness, meanwhile a focus on a system can lead to continual happiness. You aren't thinking "I'll lose 10 pounds, *then* I'll be happy", but instead you can be happy knowing you didn't eat out **today**. 

***Your identity is a result of the cumulative actions you take.*** Each small action (habit) is a vote toward your identity. You don't need a unanimous vote, you just need a majority. The etymology of "Identity" has literally means "what you do continually".

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘Œ The most effective way to change your habits for the long term is to focus on who you want to be, not what you want to achieve.
