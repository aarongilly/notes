**The best, most consistent way to get good quantified-self data**

In my experience they best, most consistent way to get good quantified-self data is pairing up automated tracking with manual confirmation. If you have one without they other, you're subject to failure modes.
Automated tracking, no confirmation - bad data, missing data
Manual-only tracking - forgetfulness, laziness

Examples:
- Nightly review of automatically-tracked datapoints.
- Logging
