**Relax. Look around. Make a call.**

If you try to tackle all of your problems at once, you will fail to achieve success in all of them. Tackle them one at a time. Pick the most important one and work it until it's done, or until you get significant momentum.

As they say in the seals: Relax. Look around. Make a call.
