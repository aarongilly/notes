**A log of "good" moments, and what the context was, for analysis.**

A "Good Time Journal" is literally that - a journal (meaning "log" or "record") of what good times you've had. The idea is that you'd keep the journal up-to-date in relatively real-time. Using whatever format makes you the most engaged and whatever you'll use consistently. You write down activities you are doing that bring you a lot of energy and enthusiasm. Things that put you in flow. 

Take note of:

What was your energy level?

What was your engagement level? Were you in [[Flow]]?

What were you doing? What is motivating you?
