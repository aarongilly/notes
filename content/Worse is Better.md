**Sometimes it is better to implement something without all the bells and whistles.**

An evocative way to [[Simplicity]] is good - the phrase "**worse is better**" can be a guide when it comes to implementing features or functionality on a given application or class. When you're coding it feels good sometimes to add features, even if it comes at the expense of [[Conceptual Integrity]], it can *feel* good to have covered some oblique use case, even if [[YAGNI]].

In reality, it's usually better to do one thing, and do it well. ***That doesn't mean do one thing, and include all possible hypothetical features of that thing.*** It's okay, and perhaps *better*, to let it "feel" worse.
