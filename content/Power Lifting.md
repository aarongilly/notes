**Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift**

Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors try to out-lift one-another in 3 lifts:

1. [[Squat]] 
2. [[Deadlift]] 
3. [[Bench Press]] 

A lifter's One-Rep Max in these exercises serves as a good [[Proxy Measures]] for overall strength. 

When compared to [[Olympic Weightlifting]], Power Lifting places more of an emphasis on brute strength.

These lifts are the lifts that contribute to the "1000 Pound Club". If the sum of your one-rep max in these three lifts is >1000 pounds, you're a member. Congrats, hoss.
