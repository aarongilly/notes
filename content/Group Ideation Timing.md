**it's often best to not immediately jump into the solution space**

When having group discussions about a problem, it's often best to not immediately jump into the solution space. Spending some time thinking about and talking about the situation at hand will get the group thinking and in sync before you take time to brainstorm. Doing this allows the brainstorming session to be more effective, as people understand the goal and the factors their ideas must deal with.
