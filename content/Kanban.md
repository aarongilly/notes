**A work management tool for visualizing workflow & scope.**

## Why

Kanban boards keep you focused on a manageable number of active tasks, while keeping the other potential work ready and at hand. The Kanban visual aligns with any linear workflow, and quickly gives an overall impression of the scope on your plate & where it's at in its lifecycle.

## How To

1. Pick a tool (e.g. whiteboard & sticky notes, [[Task Manager]])
2. Define columns based on workflow steps
3. Create cards representing the tasks on your plate
4. Move cards to the right as the work traverses its workflow
5. Continuously update your board to keep it accurate

## Themes

Visualization. Management & prioritization of work.
