**Parts of your brain you can't speak with constantly analyze your situation and send you signals.**

There is a story of a study gamblers with two decks of cards. One day of card was good and one was bad but the difference was subtle. After 50-80 cards on average people were able to articulate which deck was better and why. But after just 20 cards the stress responses in their body were measurably different when drawing cards from the two decks their body had figured it out before they had. It was sending them signals through non-conscious pathways. Eg their hands got clammy.

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ You may know before you know you know.

In [[Homo Deus]] these sorts of behaviors were referred to as [[Emotional Algorithms]]. The non-verbal areas of your brain are constantly [[Thin Slicing]] your environment and sending you signals via unconscious pathways (sweat, heart rate, etc)
