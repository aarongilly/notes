**If we discover there is no free will, liberalism is doomed.**

Liberalism is the believe in the individual. And that individuals have rights and make choices according to their free will. Those choices dictate what products get made, who is voted into office, and how the distribution of work and wealth should be accomplished. What happens when science undermines the concept of the individual? What happens when free will is manipulated directly through scientific means?
