**Experiential memories are skewed towards peaks and ends.**

There are two selves - the experiencing self and the remembering self. 

The **experiencing self** is what youâ€™re going through in the moment. 

The **remembering self** is what you remember the experience to be like. 

The remembering self is **influenced by peak intensity and final intensity** with regards to any experience. This is called the "Peak-end" rule.

Studies showed that students would prefer subjecting themselves to the longer, more painful experience of having their hand in ice for a minute, then having warm water mixed in with the ice (unknown to them), rather than having their hand in ice for 45 seconds and being able to pull it out immediately.
