**Have a good (i.e. not vague) one.**

Develop a **Personal Mission Statement.** Really clarify. Develop a statement of purpose that’s actually useful. Don’t use vague, meaningless statements. You could also call the items on there your [[Guiding Principles]]. 

> [!tldr] ➡️ **[[Make the Decision that Informs all Subsequent Decisions]]**

The more specific, the better. Don’t say “I will be courageous and fair”, say “I will not avoid bold options and I will always seek to understand both sides“. Also, when possible, the more plainly stated they can be made the better.
