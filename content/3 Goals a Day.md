**Have 1-3 goals set every day.**

Each night (or each morning) make a list of **1 to 3** things you're going to accomplish with the day ahead. This will give your day a sense of clarity. It will align your energies and you'll achieve more by aiming to do less. It will help you avoid [[Never Multitask|multitasking]].

Chad Hall, the author of the [[Todoist Productivity Articles]] on the [[Medium Method]] used this technique via a [[Daily Post It]].

A good one-two punch is to pair this habit with [[Time Blocking]] to achieve [[Deep Work]] on these goals. Block 2 to 3 hours at the beginning of the day - ask yourself which of the 3 goals is most stressing you out, or which one would enable success with the others. Work only that goal until it is finished. [[Eat the Frog]].

> [!success] A person who consistently achieves 1 to 3 goals every single day is a person who's way more productive than most others.
