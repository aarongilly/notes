**`= this.summary`**

Strong [[Emergent Behavior]]s are, by definition, essentially impossible to predict. Any sufficiently *new* and/or *complex* system should be expected to have [[Unknown Unknowns]]. The only method *around* these problems is to expect to have to go through them, adjust, and try again. [[Planning Fallacy]] may lead you to believe you can one-shot kill your problems with some whiz bang new system, but they need to be stress-tested by different people in different environments and configurations. 

Put another way: **predicting future Emergence requires hindsight.**

> [!caution] If you don't expect to fail, then you will.
