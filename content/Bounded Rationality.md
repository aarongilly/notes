Bounded rationality is what occurs when an economic actor does something that **is** rational *given their perspective* on system boundaries, but with a broader perspective does them (or their population) harm.

This has to do with "The Tragedy of the Commons".

## Examples
- Farmer who gets more wool from additional sheep, procures as many sheep as they can. However too many sheep procured by all farmers leads to devastation of the land.
