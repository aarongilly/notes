**People are way more likely to follow through on actions if they have specific implementation plans.**

Implementation intentions are good for follow through. "I will exercise at 6am in the home gym on Weekdays" is better than "I will exercise more". Time and location are necessary details.

Intentions can and probably should also be set on a day-by-day basis for achieving your [[3 Goals a Day]]. 

[[Habit Stacking]] is an easy for of implementation intentions. Another specific form is [[Temptation Bundling]]. You can also use reminders, appointments (such as [[Time Blocking]]), or simple to-do lists.
