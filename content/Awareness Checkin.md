**`= this.summary`**

We are not perfect. Even when you set [[3 Goals a Day]], it doesn't do you much good unless you're actually *working on them*. This is a technique to help with that.

Periodically throughout the day[^1], stop and ask yourself some of the following things:

- Was your mind wandering when the chime went off?
- Are you working on auto-pilot or on a stated goal?
- What's the most consequential thing you could be doing right now & are you working on it?
- Are there distractions you should mitigate?

[^1]: You can use a timer on your phone, [[Pomodoro Technique üçÖ]]-like [[Time Blocking]] endpoints, [[Scheduled Breaks]] in your calendar, or possibly biological queues like needing to pee.
