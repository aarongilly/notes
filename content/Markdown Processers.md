**Marked has competition.**

The first one I learned about ‘Marked’ uses [[CommonMark]] and [[GFM]]. That’s it.

There are others. Looks like the one called ‘Remark’ is probably the best one. It’s [[CommonMark]]-compliant and extensible. Even supports [[Mermaid]] with a plugin!

It’s what Astro uses “Remark”, which has extensions for all sorts of [[Extended Markdown Syntax]].
