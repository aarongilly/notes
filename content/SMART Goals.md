**The only real way to set goals.**

Applying the SMART criteria when setting goals makes you more likely to achieve them. Goals that aren't SMART aren't *smart*. Smart goals work best when paired with [[Stretch Goals]] to avoid falling into the trap of setting ambitions too low to ensure you're able to achieve your goals.

There are a few variations on what the initialism is short for, but they generally fall into the same lines of meaning. The ones I'm going with are:

## Specific

Goals that aren't specific don't inspire action. How are you supposed to achieve something if you can't really say what it is? 

## Measurable

Goals, like anything in science, need to have measures. If you can't measure it, how will you know if you're successful? You won't be able to see progress toward a result. You won't know if you're on your way, need to work harder, or are already there.

## Actionable

You need to have some form of influence or control over your goal. Setting a goal of "getting my friend over his depression" is noble, but your ability to affect change in someone else's emotional state is limited.

Alternative "A": "Attainable". Which sort of overlaps with "realistic".

## Realistic

"Solve world hunger" is probably a bad goal. Even if that's your ends, you should set goals short of that which are more realistically achievable. You'll make more progress toward solving world hunger by feeding 100 people successfully than by trying to feed 6 billion people and failing.

See the [[2 Minute Rule of Habits]]. 

## Time-Based

Goals without an associated deadline do not inspire a sense of urgency. The purpose of goal setting is to push you out of your normal way of behavior to achieve a result, and if you don't set a time limit, you'll not have need to leave that comfort zone.
