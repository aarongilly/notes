**Gravity problems are problems like "gravity" that you can't do anything about. Accept them and move on.**

Some problems are like gravity. They are there. They aren't solvable. You are much better accepting them as a fact and moving onto ways around them. If it's not "actionable", it's not a problem. It's a constraint and it just *is*. So don't try to fight gravity. The are outside of your circle of influence. 

The music industry trying to fight against copying mp3 tracks lead to a massive downfall, before their embracement of copying (streams are streams of copied bits, after all) lead to a massive *********increase********* of revenue in the industry.
