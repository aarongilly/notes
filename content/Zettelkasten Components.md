**Notes, Links, Tags**

A Zettelkasten isn’t ONE method of note taking. There’s no wrong way to eat a Zettelkasten. There are, though, generally a few common components.

**Notes** - short notes following a simple structure

**Links** - this note is linked explicitly to that one

**Tags** - this note falls into some sort of theme
