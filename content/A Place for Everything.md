**A well organized home/workspace has a place for everything, included categorical places.**

**Create a spot for things**. Put things in their spot. Even the things that wouldn’t necessarily have a great “spot” without the effort. Go through the effort. That is where you put your keys (e.g.) when you’re not using them. Same goes for anything. You can create spots for things based on categories, such as "Power cables" or "Kitchen Cleaning Supplies". 

When possible, buy duplicates of things you utilize in multiple rooms. Then keep the copy in a designated location within each room.
