**A tool to show you which directions may be good.**

If you're not sure what you want to focus on, if you're planning your actions for the next day/week/month... this is a handy exercise to help you clarify what decisions should be made.

Ask yourself...

If there were not limitations or consequences, what would your perfect day look like?

Where would you live?

What would you do in the morning?

What would you eat for lunch?

What would your friends be like?

What would your family time be?

There are 26 questions in Taylor Pearson's article.
