**Essentially just 401(k)s for non-profits (403b) and public employees (457).**

403(b)’s are essentially a [[Traditional 401k]] for non-profit businesses (e.g. schools). 457 plans are for public employees. The contribution limits and behaviors are essentially identical. The only nice thing I’ve found is that sometimes 457 Plans are allowed to stack on other plans, for a higher overall contribution limit.
