**Schedule your day into themed blocks & behave according to those themes.**

# Definition

Time Blocking, also known as "Block Scheduling", is a productivity and time-management technique wherein you schedule your day into pre-allotted chunks, assigning an activity, project, or theme to each. During the block, you should work on the block's associated member of the [[Action→Task→Project→Area Hierarchy]]. That is, you can set aside a block to work on a given task, or project, or more generally spend time thinking about or attending to a given area. Take time to do a mental refresh before going into the block so you're head is in the right space ([[Mental Time Blocking]]). Include blocks for [[Scheduled Breaks]]. Don't worry about [[Planned Wasted Time]], because time you planned to waste cannot be wasted.

## Techniques

- [[Day Theming]] (least strict)
- [[Task Batching]]
- [[Timeboxing]] (most strict)

# Pros and Cons

## Benefits

- Assuring that the landscape of your day aligns with your priorities (and not [[Majoring in Minor Work]])
- Proper balance between P and PC work (see: [[P-PC Balance]])
- Always having clarity on what you can (and should) be working towards (see [[Antifragile Planning Method]])
- Enables [[Deep Work]], avoiding the costs of using the [[Attentional Switch]] and [[Context Loading]]
- Counteracting procrastination and perfectionism - if you assign tasks to dedicated timeframes, you are less likely to avoid work, and more likely to find “good enough” (see: [[Timeboxing]], and [[Fix Time, Flex Scope]])
- Ensuring you don’t overload your plate - by forcing tasks and Projects to have their own allocation of time, you can see in a very literal sense whether you have “room” to take on something new (see: [[Less, but Better]])
- Acts as a [[Foundational Habits]], wherein you can stack on other practices, such as [[Eat the Frog]], [[3 Goals a Day]], Or [[Ivy Lee Method]]

## Drawbacks

- It requires a lot of pre-planning
- It requires a lot of re-planning when something prevents you from sticking to your block schedule, or [[Planning Fallacy]] strikes and something takes longer than you expect
- It will be uncomfortable when you don't "feel" like doing what you've blocked off time to do, and if you fail to make [[Traction]] you will have essentially not time blocked at all.
