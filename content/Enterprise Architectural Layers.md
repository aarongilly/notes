Most (if not all) [[Enterprise Architecture Frameworks]] I've found pitch [[Enterprise Architecture]] as a layered thing. What is *not* always common, though, is the quantity of those layers - and what they are. Here's a cross section of sources.

[[UAF]] doesn't really call them "layers". Instead they are based around "domains", which have various "aspects". Frankly UAF seems overly complicated.
