**Allow the notes to become better over time using these tips.**

Don’t highlight everything. Aim for each layer being the best 10-20% of the layer below it. ([[Progressive Summarization & Essentialism]])

Don’t highlight notes when you capture them. Highlight them upon revisit when you’re looking to use them in some context. This saves time & energy, and makes highlights have a purpose. 

Each time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable/useful for your future self. Leave it better than how you found like, like when you’re camping. (see: [[Organize Notes for Action]])
