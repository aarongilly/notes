**Aim incredibly high, then do the bare minimum to achieve your goal.**

Set your goals just outside of your comfort zone. This will ensure you grow in your efforts to achieve them AND that the result will have been worth those efforts. 

After having set a lofty goal, figure out how to achieve using as little energy as possible. Be creative. Find help. Look for a [[Minimum Effective Dose]].

This is the template for high-reward, relatively low-effort endeavors. The juice is worth the squeeze.
