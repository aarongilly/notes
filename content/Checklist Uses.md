**An incomplete list of good places for checklists.**

When you might want to make (or better yet, refer to a well-edited existing) [[Checklists]]:

- Accomplishing any [[Standard Processes]]
- I'm [[Decision Making]], using it for [[Optimum Level of Information]] and to ensure you literally check your bases to not get burnt
- Planning a big project, use [[Communications Checklist]]s
