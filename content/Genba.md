**The best way to understand a customer’s problem is to go see it for yourself.**

One of the facets of [[The Toyota Way]], a “Genba” (or sometimes “Gemba”) walk is a walk around the area **where the value is made** in which you look for sources of waste. This removes any chance for the waste to be hidden by efficiencies elsewhere, allows you to understand the problems much more quickly and fully than having the issues described to you.

> [!tldr] 👉🏻 Go see for yourself.
