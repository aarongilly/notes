Self-esteem is important. This fact was widely recognized (perhaps even *over*-recognized) during the 80s and 90s. Massive top-down efforts were created to bolster the self-esteem of the nation, starting with the youth. Kids started getting "participation awards", being told they were special and great. The issue is that this trains people to make their self-esteem and self-worth contingent upon rewards and positive feedback from others. This sort of external dependency for self-esteem is unstable and easily shaken.
