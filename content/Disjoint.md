In the [[Ontology]] tool  [[Protege]], they give prominent positioning to the `Class Disjoint` feature, which was surprising. Since learning what it was, I've adopted the vocab word.

> [!cite] Disjoint
> Classes that are *disjoint* cannot have any common instance

Example disjoints:
- animalia / plantea
- internal candidate / external candidate
- EV / Gas-powered vehicle
