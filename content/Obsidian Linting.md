Although I'm trying to [[Only Use Obsidian Plug-ins That Retain Portability]], one of those plugins that clearly makes the cut is the [[Obsidian]] `Linter` plug-in to do the following:

- Add `aliases`, `tags`, and `created` [[Frontmatter]] keys
- Populate the `created` key with an [[ISO 8601]]-compliant date
- Enforce other consistency standards I don't need to enumerate here
