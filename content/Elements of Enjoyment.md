**There are 8 aspects to "enjoying" something.**

There are 8 commonly reported elements when people talk about something they enjoyed.

1. When we're doing a task we have a chance of completing
2. When we're concentrated on what we're doing
3. When the goals are clear
4. When feedback is immediate
5. When the activity feels effortless, but all-encompassing; the rest of life fades away
6. When you have a sense of control
7. When the concern for the self disappears during the task, and the definition of the self expands after
8. When our perception of time expands and contracts
