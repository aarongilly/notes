summary: BMI is biased, flawed, and straight-up wrong.
---
BMI was originally developed by *dietitians*, aka people who make money when "overweight" people want to lose weight. Their profession incentivized the developers of the BMI scale to bias it towards "average" being *less than average*. This would be all well and good if "average" actually meant *"healthy"*, but you are, in fact, **much more likely to die** if you come in just under the "healthy weight" range than if you do if you're in the first part of the "obese" range.

> [!warning] Obese is better than Underweight

## Ranges
- **Underweight:** BMI is less than 18.5
- **Normal weight:** BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
- **Overweight:** BMI is 25 to 29.9
- **Obese:** BMI is 30 or more

BMI is measured in [[SI Units]] - Kg/M^2. Weird. Actually not weird, that's exactly how it's calculated:
$$\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight in kilograms}}{(\text{height in meters})^2}$$

So, for me, right now that's:

$$\text{BMI} = \frac{101.6 kg}{2.045 m^2} = 24.3$$

I'm "healthy" now. According to their logic, if I gain 5 more pounds I'll be "at risk", but if I lost **50 pounds** I'd still be "healthy".
