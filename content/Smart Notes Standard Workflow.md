**A how-to (that I’m currently executing)**

The recommended workflow, plus my specific implementation

1. Make fleeting notes - capture ideas quickly
	    Add notes to Notion/Reminders inbox
    
2. Make literature notes - capture what you find, citing the source
	    Add notes to Notion Source page, what I’m doing right now
    
3. Make permanent notes - think about how this relates to existing notes, write the note more concisely, with the intent to have it build on or provide context to existing notes
	    Edit & transfer note to Notes database
    
4. Add it to the slip-box - **file it behind an existing note**, link it to others, add links to it from existing notes
	    Update existing notes with reference to the new one, where relevant. I don’t use the concept of “next” notes, but instead try to hyperlink to other notes in [[My Notes]] as much as possible.
    
5. Look at what you have for topics you could write about, find chains of related notes
	    From this point on, I’ve not really exercised this process
    
6. Collect relevant notes/note chains on your writing topic, on a desktop (similar to the [[Archipelago of Ideas]]  from BaSB)
7. Turn those note chains into a rough draft - translate them into something readable & fill in the gaps (both in terms of transitions between notes and gaps in your ideas/argument)
8. Edit, proofread, and publish.
		Turn into a Column or a Gillespedia article
