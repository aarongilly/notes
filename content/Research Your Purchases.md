**Avoid buying something you'll regret, either due to its lack of quality or due to its sticker price.**

Look for durability, features, value, and a good alignment with your life systems. 

Don’t always buy the cheapest thing, and don’t always buy the most expensive highest quality item. Know when you will be best served by each.

Buying things that already align with your life systems avoids the [[Diderot Effect]].
