There have been numerous studies that have associated walking a comfortable pace with better *thinking*. Numerous famous writers and intellectuals have remarked on the close relationship between *walking* and working through ideas. Among them, Henry David Thoreau (the author of [[Walden]]) and Daniel Kahnamen (the author of [[Thinking Fast and Slow]]).

If you're stuck on an idea, and perhaps even if you're *not* stuck - go for a walk!

Note: for benefits in *thinking* - only walk at a comfortable pace. Once you start to enter into [[Zone 2]] you'll have have **worse** results.
