**We sell our time to make money. We use our money to buy time.**

The adage "Time is Money" is true. 

- In [[Walden]], Henry David Thoreau talked about spending "life" instead of dollars when making purchases. ([[Trading Life, Not Money]])
- In [[Your Money or Your Life]], the authors spoke of time and money as parts of a whole, they called "[[Life Energy]]"
    - I consider them as parts of a triad ([[3 Personal Resources]])
- In [[The Organized Mind]], Daniel Levitin also suggests you [[Find the Value of Your Time]].
- Time and money can be converted between one another [[Converting Resources]]
