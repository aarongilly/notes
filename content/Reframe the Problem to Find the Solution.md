**When you're stuck on a problem, try looking at it from a new perspective.**

The competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi didn’t break the world record for eating hotdogs by asking himself “*how can I eat as many hot dogs as possible*”… instead he reframed the problem as “*how can I make eating a hot dog **easier***?” This is what lead him to think outside the box and develop his signature eating competition techniques, which allowed him to **double** the previous world record. (which were then emulated by everyone else).
