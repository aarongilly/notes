**Meditative technique: Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-identification.**

A simple acronym for how to practice mindfulness. It stands for:

**Recognize** the thought or feeling you're having.

**Allow** the thoughts or feelings to exist.

**Investigate** them - how are they manifesting in your body?

**Non-identification** - realize that feelings and sensations are fleeting. They don't have any more importance than that which you give them. They, like everything you experience, will cease to be.
