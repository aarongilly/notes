**An active-question-based habit tracking concept.**

One of the main takeaways from [[Triggers]] was the concept of the structured asking of daily [[Active Questions]] to yourself. The questions should be chosen by you, they should meet two criteria:

- They need to be important to you and move you toward the person you want to be
- They should start with "Did I do my best too..."

Marshall Goldsmith has 32 (this number changes over time) questions he answers every night. The book recommends this set as a starting point:

## Did I do my best to...

- set clear goals today
- make progress toward my goals today
- find meaning today
- be happy today
- build positive relationships today
- be fully engaged today
