"Cognitive Reappraisal" is the term for the technique in which you relabel the feelings your body is sending you towards *similar* feelings that are more productive for your situation. The common example of this is re-labeling the elevated pulse and sweaty palms you have as signs of **excitement** rather than signs of **nervousness**. 

Note - the two feelings have to be similar enough. You can't trick your mind while you're exhausted by saying "Gee whizz I'm so full of energy". Doing this doesn't work. You *miiight* be able to say "alright I am satisfied".
