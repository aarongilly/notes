Takt Time is a manufacturing/[[Six Sigma]] term meaning:

> [!tldr] The rate at which you need to produce product to meet customer demand.

It does not relate to the time it *actually* takes, aside from it being a *goal* to strive for in order to achieve [[One Piece Flow]].

### Formula:
$$ T = \frac{T_a}{D} $$
`T` = product assembly time required to meet demand
`T_a` = net time available to work
`D` = customer demand
