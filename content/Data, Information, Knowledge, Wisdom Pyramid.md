**Data** are the simple ones and zeros. They contain facts, but don't mean anything in and of themselves.

**Information** is what you glean from data consumed in context and organized. 

**Knowledge** is what you can glean from the information available to you. Knowledge happens inside the *brain*, whereas data & info can exist externally.

**Wisdom** is the correct application/response to the knowledge gained.

## Example
### Data
| Day | Wake Up Time |
| :--: | :--:|
| Mon | 6:30 |
| Tue | 6:42 |
| Wed | 6:31 |
| Thur | 6:30 |
| Fri | 6:40 |
| Sat | 8:15 |
| Sun | 8:42 |

### Info
I sleep in an hour and a half later on the weekends than I do the weekdays.

### Knowledge

### Wisdom
Perhaps this should say "I shouldn't stay up so late on Fri & Sat"
