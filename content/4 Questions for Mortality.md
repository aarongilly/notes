**Atul Gawande's recommended questions when approaching mortality.**

If you or loved one is approaching an end of life struggle, these are four go-to questions you should try to answer with your doctor and each other.

1. What is your understanding of your situation and its potential outcomes?
2. What are your fears and what are your hopes?
3. What trade-offs are you willing to make and not willing to make?
4. What course of action best serves this understanding?
