**Even simple algorithms almost often outperform expert judges, due to a reduction in noise.**

Even simplistic models (using weighted averages) often are better predictors than expert judgments. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ Experts are noisy. Simple formulas are not.

This is actually probably a large part of the benefit of [[The Checklist Manifesto ]]. Reduction of [[Noise]] when deciding what to do. Thatâ€™s my note, not from this book. This same concept was also discussed in [[Thinking Fast and Slow]]. 

You have to check that your algorithm isnâ€™t â€˜baking inâ€™ prejudices (either directly or indirectly). See [[Math & Fairness]].
