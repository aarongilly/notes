**Autonomous, encapsulated units within a system that provide one or more interfaces.**

Per VisualParadigmâ€™s online tutorials for [[Component Diagrams]]:

> In UML, Components are made up of software objects that have been classified to serve a similar purpose. **Components are considered autonomous, encapsulated units within a system or subsystem that provide one or more interfaces**.

Components are represented by the same symbol in [[UML]] and [[Archimate]] - the rectangle with two rectangles on the left:
