**My Personal [[Data Warehouse]] project.**

[On NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdw)!

This note is probably not useful, but I wanted a place to have backlinks to.

The PDW is where I’m applying a ton of concepts I’m learning about in the worlds of coding, architecture, modeling, and UI/UX design.

If you reading this are me - don’t add a lot to this note. <- you confused yourself with this one, buddy.
