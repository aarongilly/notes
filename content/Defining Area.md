# Area

Areas are facets of your life you care about. They are different domains in which you have some responsibility (to yourself or to others). You uphold some sort of a *role* in each area. Areas have **standards to be maintained**. 

### Area → Role(s)
- Writing → Writer/Critic
- Finance → Financial Manger
- House → Homeowner

Areas do not have an "end point" - although they may come and go. You cannot "achieve" or "complete" an area. Projects have those things. Areas are a logical container for [[Defining Project|project]]s, and for reference [[Note Types#Area Notes]]. Although [[Areas for Metrics May Be Different from Areas for Reference]].

According to Google's Bard - a "typical" amount of areas is in the neighborhood of 5 to 10. I had 19 at the time. I asked because I realized that I really only needed more like ~8.
