**Predicting divorce within 15 years using 15 minutes of film at 90% accuracy using conscious Thin Slicing.**

Doctor John Gottman Did a study that had married couples come in sit and be recorded while they talked about some thing in their relationship. The scientists analyzed the footage second by second and assigned an emotional state score (out of 20 different possible emotions) to both members of the couple every second. The scientists found that divorce within 15 years could be predicted the 95% accuracy after recording for an hour. After after 15 minutes of footage it could be predicted with a 90% accuracy. His study did consciously what our [[Adaptive Unconscious]] does constantly. The study made use of general behaviors and also [[Micro-Expressions]].

Using the [[Pareto Principle]] - the study found the [[4 Horsemen of Divorce]].
