**A metaphor for [[infinity]]. A hotel with a single, never ending hallway.**

Hilbert's Hotel is an imaginary hotel in which there are an [[Infinity]] of rooms in a never ending hallway (or, sometimes, different configurations of hallways). One of the key concepts was that the hotel can be full, but **also** have room for more (infinitely more, actually) new guests. It is a construct around which an argument is made for varying “”sizes” of infinity.
