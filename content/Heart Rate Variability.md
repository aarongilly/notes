summary: HRV is due to the shrinking and growing of the area the heart has to work with due to movement of the diaphragm.
---
When you breath in and out, your diaphragm goes down and up, which causes the distance the blood has to travel to the heart to shrink and grow some, so your heart speeds up and slows down to compensate for that. 

Having a high HRV is consider to be good. But also HRV is specific to the person, and varies a lot.
