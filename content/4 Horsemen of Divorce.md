**Contempt. Stonewalling. Criticism. Defensiveness.**

The [[Gottman Marriage Study]] assigned one of 20 different emotional states to each member of a couple every second during a 15 minute video recording of a conversation between the couple. The study found they were able to predict divorce within 15 years with a 95% accuracy after recording for an hour. Gottman applied the [[Pareto Principle]] to his results and found that just 4 of the 20 different states were enough to accurately predict divorce:

1. [[Contempt]]  - equally shared by both sexes
2. [[Stonewalling]]  - more often done by men
3. [[Critcism]]  - more often done by women
4. [[Defensiveness]] - I WASN'T BEING DEFENSIVE
