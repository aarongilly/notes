**"I'm not ____ enough".**

One common manifestation of [[Shame]] is the concept of "Personal Scarcity". The thought "I'm not _____ enough". Fill in the blank with anything you like: smart, pretty, strong, funny, popular, etc. These thoughts and feelings lead you to believe you don't deserve affection and that you're not "worthy" of being loved.

The opposite of personal scarcity is **not** "having a surplus of _____", it's just having [[Enough]].
