**Fica vs Federal vs Medicare vs State**

“FICA” = Federal Income Contributions Act = Social Security [[Tax Index|Tax]]

FIT = Federal Income Tax

Medicare Tax = Hospital Tax

All three of the above are separate and independent.

State Taxes are also independent of that.

You should expect to see varying withholdings from your pay stubs for each.
