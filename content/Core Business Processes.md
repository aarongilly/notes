"Core Business Processes" is an [[Enterprise Architecture]] concept that resonated strongly with me for use both in and out of the working world. 

> [!info] Core Business Process
> The **small** set of enterprise processes that defines the stable set of company-wide capabilities the company needs to execute its [[Company Operating Model]] and respond to market opportunities. 

These are the little things. The [[Pareto Analysis|vital few instead of the trivial many]]  The rote habits of the organization. Those things you do without even having to think about it. They are supported by [[Paved Roads]]. Your assets in action. They are where your efficiencies lay. Producing consistent results with low levels of variability. 

## Examples
### Business
- Customer management
- Order-to-inventory
