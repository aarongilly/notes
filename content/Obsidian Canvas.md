[[Obsidian]] put out their own barebones [[Whiteboarding App]]-like feature called "Canvas" a while back. In March 2024 they rebranded to "[JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/)". 

Canvas files are stored using a custom-build (but [[Open Source]]) file format "`.canvas`". It's simple [[JSON]], with a [[Graph Database]]-like structure. It's a map of `nodes` and `edges`.
### Example .`.canvas` File
```JSON
{
	"nodes":[
		{"id":"8edd2eb18bb22633","x":-725,"y":-460,"width":970,"height":1115,"color":"6","type":"group","label":"Embedding Scopes"},

## Canvas Pros & Cons
### Pros ðŸ’ª
- Like seemingly everything in Obsidian - canvas is **fast**.
- You can embed items into your canvas that look and work just like notes
- You can pull content from your vault easily
	- You can also "promote" parts of a canvas to full-blown standalone notes
- Support for link labels, groups, and coloring
- The file format makes a ton of sense and seems like I could expand on it
- Everything you can do on Canvas actually works really well from the iPad
### Cons ðŸ«¤
- Canvases are very much second-class citizens - and feel like it.
	- No support for backlinks
	- Search doesn't cover anything in Canvases
	- There's no [[Frontmatter]] or properties support
- There's no support for freehand drawings or anything
- "Groups" in the `.canvas` format don't actually have any sort of *explicit* membership, it looks like it's merely graphical overlap
