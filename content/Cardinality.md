**How many of a thing there are, basically.**

"Cardinality" refers to the number of elements in a set or other grouping. It's a term commonly used in Data Science to refer to number-of-instances constraints between entities sharing a given relationship in an [[Entity-Relationship Model]]. In mathematics, cardinality refers to the number of elements in a bound set. The set "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99" has a cardinality of 6. Note "Cardinality" is not "[[Arity]] ".

Not sure what this is from anymore... but a related graphic:
