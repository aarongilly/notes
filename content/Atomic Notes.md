**Notes that contain one idea, or represent one concept.**

Atomic Notes are artifacts of a specific style of notetaking - the [[Slip-Box Method]]. It stands in opposition to the most common form of notetaking - longform notes. 

**Atomic Notes contain one idea, or represent one concept**. They range in length from one sentence, to a couple of paragraphs with some associated examples. They are uniquely identified so they can be referenced from one-another.

There is no "exactly right" way to do Atomic Notetaking. Keep thoughts small enough so they can be clearly referenced, and keep them self-contained so they can be understood in a vacuum.

## Benefits of Atomic Notes over Longform

- Each note is small enough to be quickly reviewed. One of the [[6 Information Mapping Principles]].
- Each note is self-contained & can be understood without suffering [[Context Loading]]
- Notes can be built like Lego into something bigger.
- See [[Standardization Enables Creativity]]
