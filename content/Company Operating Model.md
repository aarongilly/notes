[[Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy]] defines `operating models` as:

> [!cite] Operating Model
> The necessary level of business process **integration** and **standardization** for delivering goods and services to customers.
> *- Enterprise Architecture as a Strategy*

There are metaphorical sliders for integration & standardization, the extremes of both ends are problematic. The set points should be carefully selected (by way of what actions you take), and those [[Paved Roads]] should be recognized & leveraged as assets for the business.

> [!tip] Definitions
> **Integration**: the extent to which business units utilize the same **data**
> **Standardization**: the extent to which business units utilize the same **processes**

There are [[Four Types of Company Operating Models]], based on having high or low integration and standardization levels.

Tons of Integration:
- 👍 Enables better end-to-end connectivity
- 👍 Increases efficiency of the status quo
- 👎 Requires shared understanding of data across business units
- 👎 Change management becomes more complex

Tons of Standardization:
- 👍 Efficiencies created across business units
- 👍 Reduction in variability
- 👎 Limits localized efficiencies that could be had
- 👎 Reduces the capability to innovate at the edges
