**Computers imitating human intelligence, with many advantages and disadvantages.**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is scalable, infinitely instantiatable computer-based system which can immigrate (and in most domains, ultimately surpass) human intelligence. Machine learning is a concept within Artificial Intelligence wherein AI is built out incrementally through the use of trial sampling and statistically modeling. Machine Learning produces software which works, but cannot be explained in human terms.

Artificially Intelligent systems are not subject to decision fatigue. They can carry out routines without bias (aside from the biases that are implicitly built into them). They can model and simulate millions and millions of potential futures, no matter how ridiculous and implausible they may seem. Humans quickly trim out "obviously bad"-seeming options, even if there's actually a genius solution hidden behind what seems to us thinking humans to be ridiculous.
