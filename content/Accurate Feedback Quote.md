**There isn't “positive feedback” and “negative feedback”, only accurate feedback.**

A mid-quote (probably) from “A Higher Loyalty” by James Comey:

> There isn't “positive feedback” or “negative feedback”, there is only **accurate feedback**.

…and that is what you should be giving to people. To only give positive feedback OR negative feedback is to serve your interests (either making a person like you or trying to argue your point about something) is selfish. 

This has a bit of the “radical candor” sound to it. If you love someone you want them to be the best them, thus you don't just share what they're great at, but also what they could improve on.
