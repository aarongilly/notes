**Block chain is a method of mathematically-ensured federated trust, which is potentially useful in many contexts.**

Block Chain, the enabling technology behind Bitcoin and the other crypto currencies, makes the concept of "trust" federated. We have a shared intersubjective belief in money that we've extended to include *banks* themselves. We're no longer handing each other physical money, we're keeping a sum total in a bank. Then transferring portions of it to each other when we make purchases. If the bank decided we no longer had money, made an error, or simply "went away". Blockchain distributed the responsibility of maintaining the record of transactions to everyone in the system.

The same concept that federates the trust we have in the transactions logged in Bitcoin can be utilized to federate trust in artificial intelligence.
