**Using purpose-built tools for their purpose brings satisfaction.**

## Source


It feels good to use a tool for the purpose for which it was created. There is something incredibly satisfying about using a good hammer to drive a nail, using a program to produce the content for which it was purpose-built, using the human body to run and jump, and utilizing the human mind to solve a problem. Even mopping the floor, an unenviable task, can be quite satisfying - provided well-maintained mopping equipment.
