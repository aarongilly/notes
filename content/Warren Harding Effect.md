**"Looking the Part" gets you the part, even if you're not really deserving.**

Warren Harding is widely regarded as one of the worst presidents in American history. How did he get the job? He "seemed presidential". He was tall, broad, with a commanding voice and presence. When both sides of a political party were unable to pitch their "main" guy to the other, they both compromised and settled for Warren, because he looked the part.

This same effect is why average CEO height is at least a Standard Deviation above the global average for non-CEOs. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ’¡ An inch of height is worth $789/year in salary.

Timothy Judge, an author of a study that shows this. We see someone tall and we swoon.
