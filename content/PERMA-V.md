An acronym for the different aspects of "a good life", as denoted by the author of the book "Flourish", which I haven't read yet, who's also a professor at U of Penn. 

- Positive Emotions (frequent feelings of pleasure/contentment)
- Engagement (aka [[Flow]])
- Relationships (mutual feelings of care/love/support)
- Meaning (making the world a better place)
- Achievement (reaching goals/mastery)
- Vitality (being healthy and energetic)
