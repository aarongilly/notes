summary: A problem with certain characteristics that make it solution resistant
---
Wicked problems aren't evil, they are just wicked hard. There was originally 10 characteristics of wicked problems as they were originally conceived of - but that was specific to the realm of planning & policy. Those were changed to the following six characteristics of "wickedness". 

## A wicked problem...
1. Isn't understood until a solution is formulated.
2. Have no "stopping rule", and could be worked on infinitely.
3. Don't have "right or wrong" solutions, only "good and bad" ones. 
4. Novel and unique from all others
5. Have to be solved using "one-shot" solutions, trial and error is difficult because the trials are so hard and expensive.
6. Have no alternative solution.
