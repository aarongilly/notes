**Using short bursts of experience to Induce your way to a general truth.**

Thin Slicing is using [[Inductive vs Deductive|Inductive reasoning]] to arrive at general truths about a system (usually a person) based on patterns observed in small windows of experience. Thin Slicing can be carried out systematically, using the conscious thinking mind (as in the John [[Gottman Marriage Study]]) and is also carried out constantly by the more basic parts of the brain, the [[Adaptive Unconscious]], using [[Emotional Algorithms]].

- German telegraph operators were individually identifiable by the cadence of their beeps and boops
- Malpractice Suits predicted by a doctor's tone of voice alone
- Your room is more telling than your friendship
