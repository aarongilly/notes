**Two types of approaches to checklists**

There are essentially two types of [[Checklists]].

## Read, Do

Read the thing you’re about to do, then do it. This is like a recipe.

## Do, Confirm

Do the things, then check *afterwards* to ensure they are done. This is what’s employed in surgery centers across the world. These are probably less annoying to do.

On a long enough timeline with any given “Read, Do” checklist, it becomes a “Do, Confirm” checklist.
