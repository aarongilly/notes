**Function definition diagrams depicting functional relationships and their inputs, outputs, mechanisms, and controls.**

The first IDEF (**I**ntegrated **DEF**inition) method deals with representing interrelated functions within an enterprise. The method results in a set of diagrams wherein boxes representing functions are connected graphically using lines on their four sides. Then sides each are accurate with a type of relationship a thing has with the function.

### **Inputs**

These are the things that are modified by the function to become the outputs. 

### **Controls**

These are what tell the function how to produce the correct output. 

### **Outputs**

These are what the function exists to do. 

### **Mechanisms**

These are those things which the function needs to operate, but aren’t modified by it.
