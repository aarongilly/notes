## Beguiling Events

> A system is a big black box
> Of which we can't unlock the locks,
> And all we can find out about
> Is what goes in and what comes out.
> Perceiving input-output pairs,
> Related by parameters,
> Permits us, sometimes, to relate
> An input, output, and state.
> If this relation's good and stable
> Then to predict we may be able,
> But if this fails us -- heaven forbid!
> We'll be compelled to force the lid!
> - *Kenneth Boulding, economist*
