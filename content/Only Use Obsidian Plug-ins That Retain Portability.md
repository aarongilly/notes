My approach to [[Obsidian]] is to utilize as few plug-ins as possible. This is because [[Simple is Maintainable]] and any special syntax enforced by a plug-in (like the [[Dataview Plug-in]]) will make [[My Notes]] *less* portable and *more* tightly [[Coupling|coupled]] to Obsidian and those plugins. This means I'm losing some of the potential [[Obsidian Niceties]], but doing so willingly. This is an example of [[Choose Your Own Trade-Offs]].

I decided to [[Make the Decision that Informs all Subsequent Decisions]]:

> [!tip] I will defend the portability of my notes through the commitment to plaintext & durable, open file standards.

This does **not** mean "use no plugins". This means the plaintext [[Principles I Like|principle]] I'm following needs to be considered. 

## Specific Examples
- I am using the [[Dataview Plug-in]] in a very limited capacity
- I am not using the [[Excalidraw]] *plug-in*, but instead using Excalidraw and saving the results as [[SVG]] or PNG with the drawing data baked-in. 
- I will use the [[Obsidian Linting]] "Linting" plugin to *enhance* portability
