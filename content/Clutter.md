**Anything beyond he peak of the money/fulfillment curve.**

Clutter is anything above the peak of the money/fulfillment curve. Clutter is anything I’m your life that doesn’t serve your values or needs. Clutter is not JUST material possessions. It is extra appointments, extra work, extra work spent on things that don’t matter.
