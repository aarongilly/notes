**`= this.summary`**

A "System" is a somewhat vaguely-defined term. Some say anything composed of >1 interacting parts are "systems". Others have higher thresholds. Some say systems are mental constructs, others say they only exist in the real world. Long story short, the definition sucks, is abstract, and arguable in every instance.

One definition I like:
> a System is any set of related parts for which there is sufficient coherence between the parts to make viewing them as a whole useful.
> [[Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge|SEBoK]] pg 95

Systems may be **Open (interacting with an environment)** or **Closed**. Systems have (and are arguably defined by) boundaries.

Systems exhibit complexity and emergence.
