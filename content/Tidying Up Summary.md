**One paragraph summarizing "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up".**

Pile everything you own by type on the floor. Touch everything physically and ask "does this spark joy" - if so, store it with care in a dedicated place where it will always live, if not throw it out. Appreciate it for what it was for you, then be rid of it. You should probably throw out a majority of the stuff, if not a vast majority.
