**Don't spend money you don't have. Avoid debt!**

A good financial rule of thumb: **Don't spend money you don't have.**

Living within your means is avoiding debt. This assures that the money you spend is going towards [[What's Important Now [[W.I.N.)]]]] and not something you long stopped appreciating. 

Avoiding debt avoids interest. The items you buy using loans often wind up costing you 3x more than their sticker price.
