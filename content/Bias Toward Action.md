**In the face of uncertainty, more often than not, *it's better to act*, even if imperfectly, than to do nothing.**

Have a bias toward action. Don't wait until you're 100% you won't fail. Just *act.* If you do, you'll have a chance to succeeding. If you fail, you'll **learn**. You'll *probably* get a chance to try again. **If you wait for the "right way" to proceed, you'll not move.** You'll not learn. You'll have zero chance of success. Put simply:

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ Doing is better than not doing.

> Fear of failure keeps us in an unsatisfied routines. Instead of daydreaming about change, reach out and attempt new things. Small steps with accompanying successes, lead to major life transitions. - Bernard Roth
