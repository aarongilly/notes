**The primary finance tip: minimize expenses!**

No matter how big your income is, you'll never be able to retire if you don't quell your ability to spend it all. If you make a million a year but spend a million a year you'll never be free from work. If you make $1000 a year but spend nothing... you are already eligible to retire!

See [[Expense Reduction Tips]], which are mostly from this book.

Stop trying to impress other people. There is no good there to you as an indicator. Conspicuous consumption just seeks to inflate the ego, which isnâ€™t a good type of pleasure.
