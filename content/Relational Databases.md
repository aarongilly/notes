**A set tables, containing rows and columns that follow a schema**

A relational database is a set of tables that contain rows and columns according to a defined schema. The tables are "relational" in that the data in each row of the table *relate* to the column they are in.

This is distinct from [[Non-Relational Databases]]  (e.g. MongoDB, Neo4j) where each record may contain a different set of fields.
