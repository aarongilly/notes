# Music

No such thing as E# (that's an F) and B# (C). "Eggs and Bacon".

## Guitar Strings

Thickest string on top. Left-most note is the Open string note.

```
E  | F  | F# | G  | G# | A -> Same note as open next string down
A  | A# | B  | C  | C# | D -> Same note as open next string down
D  | D# | E  | F  | F# | G -> Same note as open next string down
G  | G# | A  | A# | B -> 4th string is tuned differently
B  | C  | C# | D  | D# | E -> Same note as open next string down
E  | F  | F# | A  | A# | BNotes
```
