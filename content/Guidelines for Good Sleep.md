**A few tips I've seen many places.**

### Guidelines for Good Sleep

- Go to bed at the same time every night
- Wake up at the same time every morning
    - Align timing with with your [[Chronotype & the 3 Birds]]
- If you have to stay up late one night, donâ€™t sleep in to make up for it
- Sleep in a cool, dark room
- No screens for an hour before bed
- No caffeine after 4pm (needs 6+ hours without caffeine before sleep)
- Sleep [[Enough]], but not too much - your needs may vary but most people need somewhere around 7-8 hours ([[Sleep Duration]])
- Naps should be shorter than 40 minutes
    - Naps recalibrate emotional baselines
    - [[Naps]] are incredible
    - See [[Naps]]
