summary: Make each workout harder than the last, possible in a number of ways.
---
The way to get stronger and make muscles bigger is to apply progressive overload. This means making each type of lift on successive workout sessions just a bit harder than it was last time. This can be done in a number of ways:

- increasing reps in the set
- increasing sets (less common)
- increasing weight
- decreasing rest time

Those are the "main" methods, but Jeff Nippard suggests a few other methods, too.

- changing [[Lifting Tempo]]
- focus on a full range of motion
- increasing mind-muscle connection
