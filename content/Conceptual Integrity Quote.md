## Conceptual Integrity Quote

> I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit certian anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many independent and uncoordinated ideas. - Fred Brooks, author of ‘The Mythical Man-Month’
