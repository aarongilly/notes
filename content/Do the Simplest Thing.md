**Basic life advice that’s almost always been right**

A lesson you’ve learned over and over again:  

> [!tip] **Do the simplest thing.** 

This has come in various forms:

- When choosing between options, pick the one with fewer moving parts and dependencies.
	- *Especially* when making plans involving coordination of multiple parties. Complexity causes confusion, confusion hurts execution.
- Don’t start from scratch when it’s simpler to use an existing system. [[Don’t Reinvent Things]]
- Don’t solve hypothetical problems. [[YAGNI]]
- Set simple goals. Apply yourself to achieving them in the simplest possible way. [[SMART Goals]]
- Know [[When to Decide]] is probably earlier than you expect ([[Optimum Level of Information]]), then [[Decide and Move On]]
- Consistently performing simple [[2 Minute Rule of Habits]] or [[2 Minute Rule of GTD]] will yield better long-term results.
