**Total Daily Energy Expenditure - how many calories you expend on an average day.**

TDEE is Total Daily Energy Expenditure - it is how many calories you expend on an average day. It is essentially your [[BMR]] + the caloric cost of activity undertaken in a typical day. So if your typical day is fairly sedentary, BMR is pretty close to TDEE. Or, if you're a pretty active person you may have a TDEE that is 500+ calories above your BMR. Note, though that [[BMR is most of TDEE]].

Your TDEE is the number you should compare your caloric intake to for the purposes of controlling your weight.
