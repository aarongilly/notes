**Bullet Journaling, one bullet at a time.**

Rapid logging is a style of logging that is good for a quick running throughout the day style note taking. Each note is one line, and about one topic. If you have related blocks, you can indent them. Begin each line with a little symbol saying what kind of line it is - task, event, note, or whatever else.
