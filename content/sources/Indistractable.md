## Review
For a book about [[focus]], this one seems to meander a lot.
### Abstract

Indistractible is all about the philosophy of distraction and strategies for how to avoid its worst effects.

You cannot be distracted unless you know what youâ€™re trying to do. Be clear and intentional. All motivation stems from a desire to get away from discomfort. Ask yourself why you're uncomfortable when you're getting distracted. Set aside specific blocks of time to do actions that align with your values to ensure they get done. Never fail on your appointments with yourself. For everything distracting you that isn't in your head, ask yourself "is this trigger serving me or am I serving it?". Put effort between you and the things that you want to stop doing
