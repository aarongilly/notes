## Review
I don't see why this book is so well regarded. It wasn't all that entertaining and didn't really have anything all that revolutionary to say. For some reason I got particularly hung up on the message "people who smoke more than 5 cigarettes a day are more likely to become addicted to cigarettes than people who don't". No duh. I get there's a more nuanced point there, that there is a number that represents a threshold of nicotine that causes a dependency... but the whole book reads sort of like a series of case examples that are only loosely tied together
