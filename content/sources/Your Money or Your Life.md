## Review
Your Money or Your Life is one of the earliest books on the topic of "Financial Independence". It lays out a 9 Step Program to take anyone from their current financial situation to a state of financial independence. Not than that it seeks to redefine the readers relationship with money and redefine their goals. There is never a finish line for "more", so the goal needs instead to be "enough". The steps outlined in the Program range from great to obvious to questionably tedious. I will do all of them, to some extent.

Other themes covered in the book are those of consumerism and overconsumption. Ecological considerations. Health and mental well-being.
