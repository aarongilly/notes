## Review
This book is the strong opinions of one man who gets paid to sit and think. I don't hate it, but it is all over the place. It's just a book of "THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE" arguments about things that aren't necessarily as objective as presented. It seems more like a collection of Blog posts than a real overarching narrative.
