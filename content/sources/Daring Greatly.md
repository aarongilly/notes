## Review
"Daring Greatly" is a book about shame, happiness, and why we need to learn to lean into vulnerability. The author, Brene Brown, is a shame & vulnerability researcher, a professor at the University of Huston, and the presenter of [a TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability/up-next) about these topics that went viral. It's a good book that's packed with way more content and nuggets of wisdom than I was able to adequately capture here.
