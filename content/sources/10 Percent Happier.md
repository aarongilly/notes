## Review
This book is written by Dan Harris, a reporter and news anchor who famously had a panic attack while reporting live in the air. It's about his life before meditation and how it has changed his life. Dan is a skeptic, and fundamentally distrusted the grandiose claims meditation and mindfulness practitioners commonly tout and associations most people make with "McMindfulness". His credo is that meditation makes him "10% Happier". He's a surprisingly funny.
