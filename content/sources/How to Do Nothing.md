## Review
This book was more interesting than I feared. I didn't mind some of the in-depth analysis of modern art. A lot of the opinions in the book I agree with, but are also massively inconvenient for pairing up with what I enjoy doing in this world. Not so much the social media bits, specifically, but the general disdain for technologies war on our attention.
