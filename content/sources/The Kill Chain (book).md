## Review
Christian Brose was the right hand man of John McCaine for nearly a decade in the years leading up to McCaineâ€™s death. McCaine and Brose lamented that the United States military advantage over our biggest potential threat (China) was quickly eroding and with our current trajectories the situation is only going to worsen.
