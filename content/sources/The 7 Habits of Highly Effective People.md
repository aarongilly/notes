## Review
This is a classic book in the realm of personal development. Listening to it, it's like it was the first audiobook ever made. Books in this area have come a long way. This book talks around a lot of non-concrete concepts ("paradigm shift", "interdependence", "principles", and "synergy") and only occasionally dives into practical advice. Still, it is a worthwhile read and I pulled a lot from it.
