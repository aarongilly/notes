## Review
Thus far this book has the potential to join [[Atomic Habits]], GTD, and Deep Work in my pantheon of "truly worthwhile books". After having finished it, it might push Deep Work off the list. It’s both practical and philosophical. It says what it has to say and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. It’s wholly applicable to everyone.
