## Review
This was an enjoyable listen. Like with the other Yoval Noah Harari books I’ve listened to it presented a well reasoned argument eventually resulting in some crazy futuristic predictions. The jump into Dataism sort of felt out of the blue. It’s also possible that the concept is so foreign to me that no amount of setup in one book could have prepared me for it. But there was a lot of talk of algorithms as a nebulous concept and not a lot of how they got there or who created them. I never quite wrapped my head fully around his definition of the word “God”. The ability to create, manipulate, and destroy life? We have those things. Is it the ability to live forever? That seems like a bad definition, and then Dataism would only be a means to that end. Furthermore his definition of Religion I don’t fully comprehend either.
