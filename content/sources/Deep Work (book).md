## Review
Deep Work is work done during intense (and often long) periods of distraction-free focus. This may be writing a novel out in the woods in a cabin with no electricity, or it may be turning off notifications and closing out all applications other than your productivity application of choice to put together a business plan or write code.

> [!tldr] ðŸ”‘ Deep Work is focused, intentional, work, utilizing a high level of knowledge and skill, that cannot be quickly routinized by automations or scripts.
