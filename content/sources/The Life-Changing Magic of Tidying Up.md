## Review
This book & the "Spark Joy" movement has been a cultural phenomenon. Also it's been hugely influential on my wife, and, by extension, everyone in our family. Actually listening to it, though, it surprises me a bit how big it's become. It's... odd. And incredibly proscriptive without much reason. There is a lot of contradictions, actual example: "nobody has ever had an problems, and those that did...". Also, a lot of stuff about making your possessions happy.
