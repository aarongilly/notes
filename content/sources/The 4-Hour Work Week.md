## Review
I had heard about this book on various podcasts for the past several years. I never fully understood what it was about, but I knew that it was a book that existed and that it was decently popular. When I went to look for books from my local library, I put a hold on this book pretty early on - and it was the longest waiting period.

I assumed this book would be one of two things:

1. A futurist book about how the world-wide economy is trending towards automation and the average work week is going to start dropping, eventually ending up with a utopian society where everyone only works 4 Hours a Week.
2. A self-help book promising you the recipe of riches and fortune.

It's very much the latter... and yet I enjoyed the heck out of this book.
