## Review
This book is all about the idea and practical application of a method of connected goal setting called "Objectives and Key Results". It reads more like an advertisement than a "how to". It sells you on OKRs as a concept over and over, then brings in popular names to sell you on both it and them (by way of their success they're crediting to OKRs).
