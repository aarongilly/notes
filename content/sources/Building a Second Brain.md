## Review
Eh. The book is fine. The examples he uses makes me think he's never had a job in industry. Also the mechanics of how working day in and day out with a second brain aren't really demonstrated in any tangible way. The book more serves as an overview of his general approach and organization structure, which admittedly I do like.
