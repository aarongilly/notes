## Review
This book is one of those ones where you get reaaaally tired of hearing a certain word over and over again. It also falls prey to several bits of "this would be better as a text-based book, I shouldn't have listened to this." Nevertheless, it was interesting enough for me to finish. The basic premise is: infinity is weird.
