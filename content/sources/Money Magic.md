## Review
Wow this book is hard to listen to. So many percentages and numbers and whatnot. Also the dude is a totally out there when it comes to things like “put a price limit on whether you should get a divorce”. The entire book goes into lots of details on ways wherein you can maximize your lifetime discretionary spending, typically by doing crap that you'd immediately want to use your discretionary spending to undo (e.g. live with your mom).

The metric by which every decision in this book is made is “maximized discretionary spending during your lifetime”.
