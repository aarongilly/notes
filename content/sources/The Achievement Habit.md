## Review
This is another book of pragmatic advice along the same lines as [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]], [[The 4-Hour Work Week]], and [[Atomic Habits]]

Bernard Roth is a self-proclaimed father of "design thinking", which I find a bit pretentious.

From the website for this book:

1. **Why using reasons (excuses), even legitimate ones, to explain one's behavior is self-defeating**
2. **How to change your self-image into one of a doer and achiever**
3. **How subtle language changes can resolve existential dilemmas and barriers to action**
4. **How to build resiliency by reinforcing what you do rather than what you accomplish**
5. **How to be open to learning from your own experience and from those around you**
6. **How to solve difficult personal and professional problems**
