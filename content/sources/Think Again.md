## Review
This book is a quick read due to its length and also the manner in which the content is presented. It is primarily about the joy of being wrong and getting to correct your incorrect beliefs. Also some about how to help others do this.

Some of the jokes in this book are real bad. I appreciate the attempts, but maaaan they are lame.
