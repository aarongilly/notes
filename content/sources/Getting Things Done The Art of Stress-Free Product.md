## Review
The main goal is to have a clear mind. Trust that your system will remind you of things you need to know when you need to know them. Being 100% present is the optimal state and can only be done if you can fully [[focus]] on what’s in front of you, which you can only do if you’ve handled everything else via the system. This gives you the greatest chance to operate in “Flow” (that state of total engagement with what you’re doing, where time stops passing). Thinking about something you have to do in a situation where you can’t do anything about it does no good and creates unnecessary stress.
