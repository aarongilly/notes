## Review
The Toyota Way is a systemic philosophy that enabled the slow, accumulative build up of the Toyota Production System - a series of related tools and techniques that have made Toyota THE manufacturing king.

The Toyota Way, in this book, is split into “the four Ps”: philosophy, process, people, and problem solving.

It is best to be selective with which processes you automate. If you haven’t worked out the process manually, then it will not be clear where automation is necessary.
