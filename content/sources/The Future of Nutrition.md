## Review
I didn't like this book. Not because I like eating animals, but because the author came across as jaded and pretentious... also he wrote not just one book, but several, and I suspect they all say essentially the exact same thing over and over: eat a whole plant-based diet and anyone who tells you animals are better to eat are wrong at best or deliberately lying to you.
