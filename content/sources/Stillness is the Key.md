## Review
Thus far, it sounds like Holiday is pointing at a lot of good, vaguely related things, and labeling them with a vocab word then selling it as a philosophy. A bit further into the book, I feel less like this is a problem. Ryan Holiday has made a decent case for his arguments. The book deals a lot with stoicism. Ryan Holiday is a modern Stoicist. The longest chapter of the book, by far, was the one about Winston Churchill, which seemed weird and out of place.
