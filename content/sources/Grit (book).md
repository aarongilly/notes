## Review
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals (read: years on years on end). It is sticking with something after the going gets tough... then continuing to stick with it after it gets easy again and through more easy/hard cycles. It is choosing to explore one topic, subject, or passion deeper rather than choosing to move onto something else. As the Author states, Grit is falling seven times, and rising eight.
