**5 Rough Zones & How They Benefit You**

Polar & Apple suggest there are 5 "zones", based on your maximum heart rate. The Mayo Clinic is a little less granular. They both agree on the max heart rate formula:

> [!NOTE] **Max Heart Rate Approximation**:
> $$ 220 - \text{your age in years} $$

If you're using the five zone approach, they typically break out zones by decades of percentages of Max Heart Rate from 50% to 100%. So for a 35 year old you'd get:

### Apple Zones
220 - 35 = 185bpm 

| Zone | Lowest HR in Zone |
|--|--|
|5|170|
| 4|158|
|3|146|
| 2 | 134|
| 1 |  below 133 |

## Why They're Important
The different heart rate zones tap into the [[3 Types of Energy Supply in Mammals]] differently.

### Mayo Clinic's Heart Rate Zones

These are the heart rate zones referred to in the [[Ideal Exercise Regiment]]. These are agreed on by the American Heart Association and the Mayo Clinic.

### Resting - below 50% HRMAX

For most people this is ~60 to 100 beats per minute.

### Moderate - 50-70% of HRMAX

Quicker breathing. Sweat after ~10 minutes. Can converse, but not sing.

### Vigorous - 70-85% of HRMAX

Deep, rapid breathing. Sweat after a few minutes. Cannot speak more than a few words at a time.

### Too hard - above 85% of HRMAX

Above 85% is too hard for sustained activity. This is where you start "sucking wind".

# Polar & Apple's 5 Heart Rate Zones

### Zone 1 - Very Light - 50-60% of HRMAX

Good for recovery. Basically walking.

### [[Zone 2]] - Light - 60-70% of HRMAX

Good for general endurance. Should be able to go for a long time at this intensity.

### Zone 3 - Moderate - 70-80% of HRMAX

Improves circulatory efficiency, strengthens the heart. Lactic acid starts to accumulate.

### Zone 4 - Hard - 80-90% of HRMAX

Breathing hard here. Training your body to use carbs for energy & withstand higher levels of lactic acid for longer.

### Zone 5 - Maximum - 90-100% of HRMAX

You cannot maintain this for more than a couple minutes. Lactic acid gets built up quickly. This is where you're operating during the hard parts of [[HIIT]].
