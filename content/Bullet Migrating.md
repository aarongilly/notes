**A periodic task that reengages you with your work.**

As you move from period to period (month to month, year to year, etc) you have to reflect on the previous time. What didn't you get accomplished? Is it worth migrating forward to the next period? If so, do it. If not, don't do it. The migration ensures that you know everything that's on your plate, and that you have agreed with yourself that it should be there. The friction of migration is a **feature, not a bug.** It's the [[Zero-Based Budgeting]] of task management.

It would be like moving everything in your [[Kanban]] from the "in progress" to your "to do" or your "cancelled" columns every week.
