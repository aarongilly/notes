**`= this.summary`**

An MOS is a framework around which an organization (N>1) can define/express their approach to goals, processes, and tools. There are apparently some templates out there that you could use, but in my experience it's more ad-hoc.

## Elements
- Overarching goal - [[Begin with the End in Mind]]
- [[What is a Strategy|Strategy]] - create a visual representation of activities to the strategy to marry participants to how you plan to win
- [[Metrics]] - give transparency to how you're doing as an org
- Key Activities - these are **the day-to-day building blocks** to architect around
	- e.g. - daily stand-ups, weekly group reviews, periodic summits
- Roles - who's who and who's responsible for what
- [[Budget]]/Costing - if necessary pointers to budgeting

## Tips
1. Start with a goal. This makes it obvious what the MOS is supporting, and good [[Goal Presence]] keeps team members focused and aligned.
2. Be intentional
3. [[Work the System]] - update your [[Standard Processes]] as you learn.
