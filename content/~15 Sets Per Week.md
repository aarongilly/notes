**A good target for each body part for hypertrophy.**

~15 sets for each [[Major Muscle Groups|Muscle Group]] per week is apparently a good recommendation by many people in the “science-based fitness” community. Beginners are slightly less than 15, intermediate are maybe slightly over 15. 

But also there is a [[Law of Diminishing Returns]] with reps. [[Pareto Principle]] applies here. You can do a lot with just a little bit of working out.

This is ideally split out over two (to 4) workout sessions. So, 8 sets for shoulders on Tuesday, another 8 on Friday.
