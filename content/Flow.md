**A peak human experience.**

Flow is a term coined by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi (author of *"[[Flow (book)]]")* to describe, a peak human experience. Flow is synonymous with "**being in the zone**". It's when you're performing an incredibly challenging task utilizing incredible skill, all the while experiencing a sort of relaxed state of Zen. It's been described by artists, scientists, and athletes alike. It occurs when highly talented people utilize the full extent of those talents to achieve great things.

In her book "*Grit*" Angela Duckworth says people with high levels of [[Grit]] will experience more flow in their lives.

In his book "*[[Atomic Habits]]*" James Clear says you find flow by working at the [[Edge of Capability]].
