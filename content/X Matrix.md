**A Business Alignment, Goal-setting, and Strategy Tool**

An X matrix is called an X matrix because it literally draws a big "X". It separates out four categories and shows the linkage between them. 
1. [[What is a Strategy|strategic]] objectives
2. Annual objectives
3. Improvement initiatives (or [[Targets to Improve|TTIs]])
4. Measurable improvement targets ([[KPIs]])
5. People who are associated with the improvement initiatives - can be a [[Responsibility Assignment Matrix]]

The corners of the matrix effectively map:
- Strategic Objectives to Annual Objectives (bottom left)
- Annual Objectives to Improvement Initiatives (top left)
- Improvement Initiatives to [[KPIs]] (top right-ish)
- People to Initiatives and KPIs (top right-most)
- ... and also KPIs to the long-term objective they support (bottom-right)

## Purpose
For *[[What is a Strategy|strategy]]*. Forces you to select a small number of important initiatives. Sets long-term strategy, then breaks it down into shorter term goals, which are measurable.

Its purpose is NOT to :
- communicate to workers what they should be doing. They shouldn't have to care about the mechanics of how the strategy works.
- track progress on things, the [[KPIs]] should have their own dashboards & whatnot
