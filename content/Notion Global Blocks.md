**Copy by reference IS a thing**

This page is effectively useless now that **synced blocks** are officially supported. Use those.

# Global Block Hack

Have `one block` in many places throughout Notion. Update it anywhere, it updates *everywhere*. 

## How to do it

Copy the target block's link. That looks like this: 
[[Notion-Global-Blocks-743daa72d5964ac58ef14a3df9f0e7b4#7b8170e2342144d9b355e652bdbf36a2`](Notion Global Blocks]]  

Take that url, remove the middle chunk - everything to the right of the `/`, up to (and including) the `#`.

### In short - turn this:

[[Notion-Global-Blocks-](Notion Global Blocks]]743daa72d5964ac58ef14a3df9f0e7b4#7b8170e2342144d9b355e652bdbf36a2

### Into this:

[[]]

Then paste that link into your desired location. When presented the option, choose "as link to page". Note you cannot have the same block on one PAGE more than once.
