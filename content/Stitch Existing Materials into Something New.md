**Remix previous [[Intermediate Packets]] into a your new project.**

You can treat previously generated [[Intermediate Packets]] like Lego blocks. Assemble them together and build something new, using your old stuff. This is a generalization of the process the dude who created ‘The Zettelkasten Method’ used to create new long-form content. String together mostly completed chunks, then just work on the filler & transitions. Tiago called this **The Archipelago Method**, because the archipelago are a bunch of little disconnected islands. You just have to build the bridges between them.
