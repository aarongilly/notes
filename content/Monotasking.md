**Get more done less stressfully by doing one thing at a time. **

You can do anything, but you canâ€™t do everything. Not all at once, at least. Multitasking may not be a as complete fallacy (as some claim), but the typical kinds we think of when somebody talks about it - those kinds are a bad idea.

**Working intently on one thing at a time (until you've hit a natural pausing point) is the key to doing high quality, low stress work.** 

You cannot have a breakthrough on something while thinking about something else. Juggling several tasks at once leads to poor performance on all of them, burnout, and undue stress.
