**Buddhism teaches the freedom from cravings is true happiness.**

We are influenced by cravings. Cravings toward pleasure, cravings to be away from pain. These cravings are what breed discontent. Discontent is unhappiness. Thereby, **real happiness has nothing to do with having a lot of pleasure or being free from displeasure, but instead being free from the craving for more pleasure and less displeasure**. The state of being free from cravings and the desire to control reality is called “Nirvana”, and something that Buddha achieved... and *possibly* others.

This is a core feature of Buddhism, which is a religion heavily based around happiness.
