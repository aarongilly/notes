**The Plain Text Life** was [an article by Mark WK](http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html), but it's more or less a philosophy I've come around on in my own terms. [[My Notes]] are a dedication to a plaintext-backed system. My [[PDW]] has been written to enable portability, one of the first things I built was methods to convert my entries between [[CSV]], [[YAML]], and [[JSON]].

Plaintext is about keeping things simple, because [[Simple is Maintainable]]. It avoids lock-in. It maximizes interoperability. It's the best.
