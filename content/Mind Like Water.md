**A mental and emotional state where you're able to respond appropriately to inputs, without distraction.**

One of the recurring themes in the GTD book was the goal of achieving “Mind Like Water”. 

Mind Like Water is a state where you are able to react without issue to the situation at hand, like how water freely forms to match the inside of whatever shape contain it is poured in.

> Mind Like Water: A mental and emotional state in which your head is clear, able to create and respond freely, unencumbered with distractions and split [[focus]].
