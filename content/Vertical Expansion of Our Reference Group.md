**No longer "keeping up with the Joneses", now it's keeping up with the Kardashians. **

Technology has enabled/doomed us by expanding our range of comparisons to those people who have the best of everything and are the best at everything. You're no longer the big fish in a small pond, the entire ocean has become small. 

You're not as rich as Elon Musk, or as handsome as Brad Pitt, or pretty as Jennifer Aniston, or as sexy as the girl on the cover of (whatever) or as funny as the guy from that movie.
