**Dopamine is the chemical that motivates us. (Serotonin is the one that makes us happy)**

> [!tldr] ➡️ Dopamine is chemical motivation.

Novelty causes a dopamine hit. Which motivates us to seek new novelty. This was good back before novelty was available on every screen. But now it works against you making focused progress on anything. 

Constant novelty leads to constant dopamine which leads to a lack of motivation to do hard things.
