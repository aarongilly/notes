**A collection of highly influential & important coders**

## Ada Lovelace

The first computer programmer. Essentially invented CS. Coined the term “bug” in the machine due to an actual moth that caused a computer to malfunction.

## Linus Torvalds

Linus created Linux. No big deal. He then went on to create [[Git]]. Dude’s a legend.

## Tim Berners-Lee

Created the Internet and the first browser.

    These three individuals are widely known for their contributions in the world of computer science. Ada Lovelace is widely credited as the first computer programmer, and her work with the Analytical Engine is still studied today. Linus Torvald was the creator of Linux, a widely used open source operating system. Tim Berners-Lee is credited with creating the first web browser, which changed the way people access and interact with information.
    
    Ada Lovelace was a pioneer in the field of computer science. She wrote algorithms for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer, and is often credited as the first computer programmer. Lovelace's algorithms for the Analytical Engine were detailed and comprehensive, and demonstrated her understanding of the possibilities of computing.
    
    Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux, a popular open source operating system. Torvalds is credited with making the source code of the operating system freely available, thus allowing it to be used and modified by anyone. Linux has been used in a variety of applications, including web servers, embedded systems, and personal computers.
    
    Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. He proposed the idea of a networked system of computers that could be accessed by anyone, and developed the first web browser and web server. Berners-Lee's contributions to the world of computing are still felt today, as the web has revolutionized the way we access and interact with information.

    Linus Torvalds is also known for creating the version control system Git. This system is used for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work between multiple people. It is now a standard tool for many software developers, allowing them to keep track of their work and collaborate with others on large projects. Git has revolutionized the way we collaborate on software development projects, making it easier to work together on complex projects.
