> [!tldr] When in doubt, don’t hire. A company should limit its growth to how quickly they can hire **the right** people.

When you know you need to make a people change, act. First by moving them around within the company, but if they don’t find a spot in which they can flourish after a move or two, get them off the bus.

Best people on the biggest opportunities, not the biggest problems. If you manage to jettison the problem, then you don’t jettison the people.

You want vigorous debate that leads to a unanimous backing of the eventual decision, even if it wasn’t their pitch or first choice.
