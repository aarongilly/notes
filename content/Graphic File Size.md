**Smallest files: DrawIO + SVG for diagrams**

I created this graphic:
![[SVG.svg]]

Using [[DrawIO]] and [[Excalidraw]], saving both as [[SVG]] and as PNG images, saving both of *those* with the diagram info embedded and without it. 

| Application | Format | Diagram Embed | Size |
|:--|--|:--:|:--:|
| DrawIO | SVG | No | 9KB |
| DrawIO | SVG | Yes | 11KB |
| DrawIO | PNG | No | 18KB |
| DrawIO | PNG | Yes | 25KB |
| Excalidraw | SVG | No | 34KB | 
| Excalidraw | PNG | No | 259KB |

Obviously this depends on the image, but it seems like for this type of graphic (one I expect I'd use a lot) it goes:
- DrawIO better than Excalidraw
- SVG better than PNG
