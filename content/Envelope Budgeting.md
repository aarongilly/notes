**An old school, hard budgeting technique requiring physical money**

Envelop budgeting is an old-school [[Budget]]ing mechanism. 

How to:

1. Decide on what categories of spending you want
2. Grab & label paper envelopes, one per category
3. Each month, fill those envelopes with paper money
4. When spending money on a thing, pull it from the envelope associated with that thing
5. If your envelope runs out of money, donâ€™t spend any more
