**Rule of Thumb: When 4% covers 80% of your pre-retirement income.**

There's a whole industry of professionals dedicated to answering this question considering your specific circumstancesâ€¦ but here are some gross rules of thumb.

[[The 4% Rule]] - your annual income needs divided by 0.04

Annual Income needs vary highly, but average out to be about 80% of what they were pre-retirement. 

Target Retirement Savings by Age

|  Age | Annual Salary |
| --- | --- |
| 30 | 1x annual salary |
| 40 | 3x annual salary |
| 50 | 6x annual salary |
| 60 | 8x annual salary |
| 67 | 10x annual salary |

Note: your [[Tax-Advantaged Accounts]] have constraints about when you can take distributions without incurring penalties.
