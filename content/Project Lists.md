**A list of medium sized objectives, and their associated tasks and notes.**

The project list serves as a manifest of the things you want to do. It is a container for tasks and notes associated with each of those things. They are a house for the [[Contextual Reminders]] associated with a given Objective.

Keeping a project list current and tidy is a great way to achieve clarity. Thatâ€™s why reviewing open projects is a main component of the [[Weekly Review]].
