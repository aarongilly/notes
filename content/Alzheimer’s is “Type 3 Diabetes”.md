**Alzheimer’s is so heavily linked to Diabetes, it’s been referred to as ‘type 3’**

There is a significant correlation between Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. So much so that it’s been referred to as “Type 3 Diabetes”. It’s wasn’t clear (to me) if there’s actually an implied direct causality, but what was clear was that the behaviors and lifestyles that make you prone to one definitely also make you prone to the other.
