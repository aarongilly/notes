**Personal Knowledge Management  - what this is trying to do **

Personal knowledge management is **not just about note taking**, it's also about giving yourself tools to better access, canvas, and pull up relevant knowledge (e.g. [[Intermediate Packets]]) when the time comes. [[Evergreen Notes|Note]] apps like Roam Research, [[Obsidian]], and [[Notion]] are synonymous with PKM, but just as important would be things like your contacts list, [[Calendars are the Most Important Productivity Tool|calendar]], etc.
