**If you aren't choosing your own trade-offs, they will be chosen for you.**

Because resources are limited ([[Anything, but Not Everything]]), everything is a trade-off. You should be taking a hypervigilant role in choosing the trade-offs you're making for yourself. If you don't, they will be chosen for you. 

## Examples

- If you don't fight for your nights and weekends, you may lose them to "extra tasks" at work.
- If you don't budget smartly, you're money will be out before you've covered your wants.
