**The self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought: if I look perfect and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the feelings of shame, judgment, and blame**

Pefectionism is the self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought: if I look perfect and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.

Perfectionism is one of the [[Vulnerability Shields]] we carry around. We think it helps us be protected from damage, when in reality all it's really doing is weighing us down and making us paranoid.
