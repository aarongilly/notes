**When negotiating, repeat people’s words to them, and take time.**

More than the “mirror someone’s body language” technique, a simple act of repeating someone’s final few words (or few key words from their point) has a powerful effect on them feeling heard. Mirroring takes time. 4 seconds of silence. 

- Repeat the key part of the message you heard, a couple words
- SLOW DOWN
