**Know why you are doing what you're doing.**

Habit 2 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Begin with the end in mind. Also about *half* of the content of "[[Start with Why (source)]]" (the non-"how to sell stuff" parts).

1. [[Be Principle-Centered]] 
2. [[5 Why to Your Values]] 
3. Come up with a [[Mission Statement]].
