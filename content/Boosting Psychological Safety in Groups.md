**Some techniques that may foster more productive, happier teams.**

## Equal Conversation

Everyone in a group should have equitable conversational attention. Teams should, on the whole, share the responsibility of "speaker" evenly. The loudest shouldn't be easy to detect. The quietest should be encouraged to speak up. 

## Social Empathy

Good teams are full of people who are attuned to each other's body language and expressions. These subtle cues should not be ignored between teammates.
