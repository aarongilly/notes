**When too many options leads to choosing none. **

Target Confusion is what happens when you fail to select an option when making a choice because you weren't sure which one to shoot for. The term describes hunters who've stocked their game for hours, then suddenly find themselves looking at an entire flock, who are given a good opportunity to shoot any one of them, but cannot choose which is the most likely target. 

It applies to much more than just hunting, though. Too many options can be daunting. [[Wealth of Information ⇒ Poverty of Attention]]. You can suffer from analysis paralysis. You may try chasing two rabbits and losing them both.
