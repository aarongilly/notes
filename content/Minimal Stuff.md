**Love all that you own, own only what you love.**

Minimalism is a celebration of stuff, not a celebration of denial. Nobody loves their things more than the people on /r/OneBag, and that is because they are celebrating those things that really bring them great value. If you’re living out of a backpack, you’ve got no room for “okay”. 

You get a lot more enjoyment out of spending $50 one, truly great shirt that looks awesome and fits you perfectly than you would from buying five $10 shirts that each are... okay.

Mo money, mo problems. More stuff, less freedom. If you can reduce your needs to zero, you are truly free. There's nothing anyone can take from you, and nothing you can be bought with. Luxury is the wolf at the door. Comfort creep - you become blind to the comforts you have as you seek more. The [[hedonic treadmill]] applies to comfort, too. Make room.
