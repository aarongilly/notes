**Prepare for Deep Work the way you'd prepare to go into the theater.**

You need to prepare to do work the same way you'd prepare to watch a movie. Prepare to immerse yourself and sit For a couple hours. 

Pee. Stretch. Get a drink. Turn your phone off.

Do a pre-work prep ritual so you can actually do the work.
