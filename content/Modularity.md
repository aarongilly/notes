**A property of systems**

Modularity is not inherently a good thing, nor a bad thing. 

## Pros
- Modularity enables flexibility & extensibility
- Modularity means there was some foresight put into how the system is architected, there is some form of [[Standard Processes]] for integrating/upgrading parts to a system

## Cons
- Sometimes flexibility is *bad*.
	- See how [[Obsidian]] notes are a bit less uniform than your [[Notion]] notes were
- Modularity brings with it some level of overhead that may not be necessary.
