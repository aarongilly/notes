**Phrase people use when doing bad things for (supposedly) good reasons**

“The ends justify the means” is a phrase people use when they do bad things for good reasons.

It’s caused tremendous suffering and loss for all of humanity. It’s also certainly been true in certain, limited cases. “The Ends Justify the Means” is the argument I could imagine Hitler having made about he Holocaust. See [[ Ends Justify Means  & Evil]].

In the end, if you’re rationalizing “The ends justify the means” - you better ask yourself if you’re deluding yourself. Could you convince whoever is being wronged by ‘the means’?
