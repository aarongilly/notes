I'm not 100% on what this note should have in it... but this topic comes up a lot.

A good [[Personal MOS]] will enable consistent progress on [[Prefer a Long-Term Philosophy|long-term]] goals.

[[Fitness Periodic Meta Routine]] is something that only comes about through design & intent.

It's good to establish **macro-level** situations where you can respond to **micro-level** needs and wants. This allows you to ask yourself [[What is this Situation Asking of Me]]?
	*Example:* 
	[[Intermittent Collaboration]] is the best way to innovate and be productive. It relies on being in situations that facilitate collaboration AND situations that enable solitary thought/experimentation.
