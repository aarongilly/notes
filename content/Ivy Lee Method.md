**End each day with a prioritized list of 6 things to work on tomorrow. Start each day working on tasks from yesterday’s list, one at a time.**

Ivy Lee, a Public Relations expert and business man offers this advice (as summarized by James Clear):

1. At the **end** of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.
2. Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.
3. When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.
4. Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.
5. Repeat this process every working day.

## Why it Works
- It forces you to choose your priorities.
- It increases [[Goal Presence]]
- It forces you to work in one thing at a time.
- It enables you to hit the ground running in the morning.
