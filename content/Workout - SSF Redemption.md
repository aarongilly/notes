**Basic Big 6 Routine**

Simple beginner routine. 3 days a week. Very similar to Starting Strength. Weeks go ABA → BAB.

- 3x/week
- Beginner
- Barbell weight training
- Strength and core

## Day A

1. [[Bench Press]] 
    
    3 sets, 5-8 reps, 3 min rest
    
2. [[Squat]] 
    
    3 sets, 5-8 reps, 3 min rest
    
3. Chin-Up
    
    3 sets, 1-15 reps, 2 min rest

## Day B

1. [[Deadlift]] 
    
    1 set, 5 reps
    
2. [[Overhead Press]] 
    
    3 sets, 5-8 reps, 3 min rest
    
3. [[Bent-Over Row]] 
    
    3 sets, 5-8 reps, 2 min rest

### Frequency

Perform a workout day (A or B) three times a week on nonconsecutive days. For example, every Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays. Each week will alternate as workouts ABA and BAB.

### Duration

Each workout is approximately 30–40 minutes long, not including warm-up and post-workout stretching.

### Cycle

Apply progressive overload for 6–8 weeks, then take one week off to allow the body and central nervous system to recover.

### Accessory Exercises

You may add accessory exercises such as the [stiff-legged deadlift](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/BBStiffLegDeadlift.html), [barbell curl](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Biceps/BBCurl.html), and [barbell calf raise](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Gastrocnemius/BBStandingCalfRaise.html).

### Expectations

Following proper diet, rest, and sleep, while applying progressive overload, you will expect to see strength and muscle increases on a bulk, or preservation of muscle mass while shedding fat on a cut.
