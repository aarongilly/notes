**NodeJS is a [[JavaScript]] runtime environment that runs on the machine, not in the browser**

NodeJS is not just about making websites (although that's been my primary use) - it allows JavaScript to interact with your machine natively. 

To run a JavaScript, open the command prompt in same directory as the JavaScript file and simply execute:

```CMD
node example.js
```

This allows you to open files, read and write to databases, whatever. You can ALSO push that stuff to work in a server in the cloud, but you don't have to. I forgot that for a while.
