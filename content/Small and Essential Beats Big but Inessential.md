**Small progress in an essential area is better than a big win on something inessential.**

Small progress in an essential area is better than a big win on something inessential. 

If you do a task 10 times a day, and can shave 10 seconds off that task, you will have saved yourself more time than eliminating 2 hours from a task that you do once a quarter. More than gross time savings, you will get to [[Love the Process]] of saving that time consistently every day, which is good for morale.
