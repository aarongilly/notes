**Never seek a life of leisure. Keep a purpose.**

Retirement is not so great if your plan is just to live a life of leisure. Those who retire without any plans other than leisure, tend to die pretty quickly. Life with no pursuits other than the pursuit of not having anything to do is an empty life. The body and the mind atrophy. The spirit does too. 

This is why [[The Happiness Equation]] suggests finding your [[Ikigai]], and recommends always being on the look out for the next potential for growth. 

> [!tldr] ðŸ‘‰ Once you finish changing. You're finished.
