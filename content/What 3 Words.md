"What 3 Words" is a map of the world, subdivided into 3m (~9'10") squares, which are all uniquely and unambiguously given a 3-position word-based index. Basically, with 3 very easy to memorize words you can refer to a pretty darn exact spot on the surface of the earth. "What 3 Words" is a global position system via [[Surrogate Keys]].

`///save.grants.tower` is the south entrance to Memorial Campanile here in Lawrence

This is possible because using words is like having a base-40,000 numbering system. You only need 3 numbers in a base-40,000 system to uniquely specify any 3m square on the surface of the earth.
