**A substance produced in one part of the body that causes action in another.**

The definition of hormone:

Substances produced in one part of the body that cause action in another. 

Hormones are only similar by definition. It's a functional definition, not a reflection of anything about them physically or chemically. They are very different from one-another.

## Example Hormones

- Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreases that causes your blood sugar to change
- [[Testosterone]] is the hormone of desire, amongst other things
- [[Noradrenaline]] and [[Adrenaline]] are hormones that do basically the same thing as each other
- [[Dopamine]] is a hormone that causes motivation
