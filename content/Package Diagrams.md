**A metamodel diagram describing the structure of a SysML/UML Model.**

Package diagrams are high-level [[Namespace]] containers. They section off parts of the [[SysML]] or [[UML]] model which they’re a part of. There is no one ‘correct’ way to organize a model, therefore package diagrams help communicate whatever means was chosen. The represent *containment,* and can represent nested packages for greater levels of organizational fidelity.

They’re also *boring*.
