**A trait of non-homogeneity that leads to the betterment of all endeavors.**

Diversity is about more than just acceptance of difference, it's about embracing the fact that differences of opinion, culture, and skills are intensely *necessary* to build a better future.

According to Steven Covey, author of [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]], Diversity is a key to synergy ([[Synergize]]). Members in truly a synergistic group cannot be homogenous. Their differences have to be looked at as an asset, not an obstacle. A good quote: "if two people have the same opinion, one is unnecessary".
