**Pre-schedule your breaks for maximum effect. Even give them an agenda.**

Daniel Pink, author of [[When (book)]], recommends pre-scheduling your breaks throughout the day. He goes on to suggest that giving the breaks an agenda is useful. 

## Example of Scheduled Breaks

- 10am - walk a lap around the building
- 12pm - go make coffee
- 12:50pm - do 5 minutes of office yoga
- 1:30pm - go talk with someone from another department about their kid
- 3pm - walk a lap around the build in the other direction
