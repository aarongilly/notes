**Set a fixed time for a type of activity, get done what you get done then move on at the allotted time.**

This is essentially just [[Timeboxing]], but it's a new way to think about it that hadn't really occurred to me before. You have to be willing to move onto the next thing, and do the thing you'd planned to do. Without that, you're more subject to one thing that doesn't deserve it taking up time from that which does. 

So, set out when you'll be doing what. When that time comes, set a realistic goal for what you'll get done in your block of time (be it measured in [[Pomodoro Technique üçÖ|tomatoes]] or not). Apparently if you stick with this long enough you'll hone the ability to marry up the *time allotted* and the *scope to accomplish*.
