**A movement of living in a house that’s radically smaller than most.**

There is no ‘official’ guidelines to make a house ‘tiny’. There is a whole culture around them. They’re growing in popularity, especially in high cost of living areas.

## Pros

- Tiny houses are more efficient than regular ones.
- They are less expensive to build, own, and maintain.
- They also take less time to maintain.
- The saved time & money can be put to other uses (travel, experiences, etc)
    - You can afford for *everything you own* to be the “nice” version of that thing

## Cons

- You have less space, obviously.
    - No home gym
    - No garage
    - No garage workshop
- You don’t have backups for things.
- You can’t spread out from other people living there.

You can just order tiny houses from [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wave-ADU-1-Bedroom-305-sq-ft-Tiny-Home-Steel-Frame-Building-Kit-Cabin-Guest-house-TWV1B270/321417497?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&&mtc=SHOPPING-CM-CML-GGL-D21-021_003_DIM_LUMBER-NA-NA-NA-SMART-2996800-NA-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NEW-D21New_Active&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-CM-CML-GGL-D21-021_003_DIM_LUMBER-NA-NA-NA-SMART-2996800-NA-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NEW-D21New_Active-71700000093711346-58700007799976626-92700070867243637&gclid=Cj0KCQjw54iXBhCXARIsADWpsG8u5siJDGpwpIXFLOXgxqrrqndpVeR-CKwiINKBU8sBfT_iIpMV29saAlm-EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
