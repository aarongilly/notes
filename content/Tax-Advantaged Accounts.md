**401k, Roth IRA, HSA, 529, etc.**

A tax-advantaged account is a kind of savings plan or financial account, providing you with a tax benefit such as tax-deferral or tax exemption. They are either of:

1. [[Tax-Deferred]]
    - [[Traditional IRAs]]
    - [[Traditional 401k]]
    - [[401(k) Offshoots 403(b) and 457]]
2. [[After-Tax Investment]] 
    1. [[Roth IRAs]] 
    2. [[Roth 401(k) 403(b) 457 Accounts]]

Another categorization possibility is:

1. [[Employer-Sponsored Savings Accounts]] 
    - [[Traditional 401k]]
    - [[401(k) Offshoots 403(b) and 457]]
    - [[Roth 401(k) 403(b) 457 Accounts]]
2. [[Individual Retirement Accounts]] 
    - [[Traditional IRAs]]
    - [[Roth IRAs]]

> [!tldr] ðŸ¤‘ In all cases **Employer-Sponsored plans & IRAs can be stacked** to increase your annual contribution limits.

There are other accounts for specific purposes:

- Education: [[529 Accounts]]
- Medical Expenses: [[HSA]]
