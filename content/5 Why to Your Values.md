**Ask why you to yourself until you hit bedrock.**

Seek to understand your reactions and emotions. Ask "why" until you get down to your core values. Become familiar with your values and why you value them. They may not be helping you.

Those core values may also help you identify subjects about which you may hold the capacity for the greatest levels of grit.
