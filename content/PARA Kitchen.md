**PARA Described in a Metaphor**

The [[PARA Method]] of organization is like a kitchen. Archives are like your freezer. Things there are in cold storage until they are needed for some specific purpose. Resources are your pantry. Things in there are not used every day, but can be called upon and are relatively frequently. Areas are like your fridge. You routinely access them, but they could sit on their own just fine for days. Projects are like what's in the pots and pans in front of you. You're actively working them, giving them constant attention.

> [!note] Notetaking is like time travel - you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.
