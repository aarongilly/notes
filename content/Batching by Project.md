**Task batching - but by Project. A way to feel progress and avoid context switching. **

When [[Task Batching]], you don't have to limit it to doing emails all at one chunk - instead, you can bash tasks by project. Open all of the relevant files and materials for a project and do the thing don't work on anything from any other projects until you're done with this one. Like batching together the same type of task, batching together tasks for the same reasons:
- avoids [[Context Loading]]
- enables [[Increased Focus, Decreased Anxiety]]
- allows you to see progress much more clearly.
