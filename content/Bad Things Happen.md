**Bad things will happen. If something bad is happening, realize that it’s normal.**

Life has its ups and downs. That’s just how it is. It’s impossible to avoid all bad things. Don’t ever think “we’ll I shouldn’t feed bad”, because that’s the normal state of being. Even if you try to live your whole life behind [[Vulnerability Shields]], you'll wind up never having really lived, which is the worst thing of all.

“[[Being Wrong]]” is an exact mirror of "being sad" or "having low-energy". It all could be generalized as "bad things exist, so don't freak out when you're in them".
