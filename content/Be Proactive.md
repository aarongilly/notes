**Think before you respond. I.E. - Don't be Reactive**

Habit 1 of the [[7 Effective Habits]]: Be Proactive 

> [!tldr] ❓ Humanity exists between stimulus and response.

Reacting without thinking is being reactive. If you have the ability to respond how you like to the external stimuli, you can rise above it. Cutely, Stephen calls the ability to respond your “responsibility”.

Marshall Goldsmith's book [[Triggers]] talks a lot about this concept with his idea of [[AIWATT]].

Dan Harris's book [[10% Happier]] also talks about how [[Meditation]] helps you separate reaction from response.
