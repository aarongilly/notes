**It's not possible to have a life with no problems. You should seek to have better problems.**

Thanks in no small part to the [[Hedonic Treadmill]] we humans are incapable of living truly carefree lives. No matter what, you will have problems in your life. However not all problems are equally problematic. The key to a good life is to design which problems you want to have. You **must** care about something. You have the ability to choose what you care about. Choose better things to care about.

Don't pray for your problem to go away, pray for the strength to deal with it - or the wisdom to realize it isn't really a problem you should be concerned with at all.
