**Because [[Obsidian]] is sometimes better than [[Notion]]**

- Obsidian is **fast**. Linking between things in Obsidian is CRAZY fast.
- Unlinked mentions is a great feature
- The extensibility of Obsidian is great. If you don't like how it looks or works, you can usually change it to make it that way.
	- Customizable menus and hot keys are dope
	- The plugins ecosystem is crazy
	- Themes and custom CSS 
- The security of having a local copy of your notes is great. Being able to create zipped "for emergencies" copies is great
- Local files open up the ability to use other applications/code in conjunction with Obisidian
	- Used NodeJS + JavaScript to mass edit notes
	- Also used VSCode for global find/replace
- Built-in `tag` support is nice, rather than hacking them
- You can use [[Obsidian URIs]] to do things from outside obsidian, like link to [[Obsidian URIs#^abcde]]

> [!NOTE]- Callouts
> Callouts aren't bad, either! Especially these collapsible ones.
