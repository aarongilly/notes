[[Obsidian]] is excellent for [[PKM]]. It hosts [[My Notes]] and works great for using the [[Smart Notes Standard Workflow]] to create [[Evergreen Notes]] and/or as part of a "[[Zettelkasten Components|Zettelkasten]]". That's the [[Use Case Diagrams|Use Case]] I've found great success with. There are others, though.

## Project Management
Like I already wrote about in this pre-existing note, it's possible: [[Obsidian for Projects]].

To be successful as a Project Manager:
- You'd need to make heavy use of the [[Dataview Plug-in]]
- You'd *probably* need to use the Daily Notes plug-in

## Long-form Writing
I'm trying this out, sort of, for my [Gillespedia](https://gillespedia.com) articles.

## Journaling
The daily notes plug-in is basically designed for this. It's all local & private.

### Quantified-Self-Specific Journaling
The [[PDW]] could be written around Obsidian as a Data Store. It *probably* wouldn't even be terribly difficult. Siri Shortcuts can be used to automatically write new notes to your designated 'Personal Data Warehouse' vault. Of course this doesn't really lend itself to *analysis*, but could be neat conceptually.

## For-Purpose Notetaking
You can spin-up specific, siloed vaults for notes about a particular thing that don't need to be tied outside that context. There are a few private use cases I could imagine [[Notion]] **not** being great for.
### Taxes
You can track the files & make notes about them and how they were used. 
### Medical Notes
You could keep medical records, doctor's visit [[Note Types#Logs]]. Use a tag to group things by doctor and/or person.

## [[System Modeling General Process]] Pre-work
A promising use case for work-related endeavors - Obsidian is **not** a great collaborative or "shared knowledge" tool (although perhaps it could be). But it is *fantastic* at accumulating, organizing, and expressing **personal** knowledge. This personal explanation of "how things work" could be forced into a consistent schema and *then* used as the basis for an [[Enterprise Architecture]] model (or simply [[Archimate]]/[[UML]]/[[SysML]]/[[UAF]]) to be built. It *may* be possible to build a translator that takes the contents of an Obsidian vault and translates them for **import** into a modeling tool. You may be able to use [[Obsidian Linting]] to assist with the cleaning.
