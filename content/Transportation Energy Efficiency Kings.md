**The best for individuals, families, large groups, and cargo.**

Not all modes of transport are the same. Not all use cases of transport are the same. Here are some highlights.

## Individual Transport

Encased recumbent bicycles are the ‘kings’ of energy efficiency

Bikes are next highest

Then walking

## Family Transport

More research needed. I assume smart cars would be the best for-purpose family travel. Obviously the family all riding individual bikes would be best, or hopping on the bus. But the use case of suburban or rural families of 4 getting to where they need to go - that’s tougher.

## Public Transport

Buses, trams, and trains are much more energy efficient than everyone sitting in traffic in their 2 ton vehicles.

## Freight Transport

Rail is the most efficient method of moving large quantities of heavy stuff over land. 

Over the ocean you don’t really have much of a choice, but in general the bigger the ship & the more cargo, the better. Maximize the ratio of {weight of stuff being moved} to {weight of thing moving the stuff}
