**Seeing the same thing, but it feeling new.**

Vuja De is literally the opposite of Deja Vu. Rather than a new situation feeling eerily familiar, Vuja de is when you're in a very familiar situation and it feels like new. This is something that you get when you see a new perspective on the daily grind, or something that a great training class can do for you. It's a good thing when it happens, because it allows you to examine your situation and what novel approaches you may use that may be better than upper status quo.
