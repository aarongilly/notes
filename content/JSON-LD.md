**A data storage format for highly linked data.**

JSON-LD is short for [[JavaScript]] Object Notation for Linked Data. It’s essentially valid JSON, but with a particular type of approach. The idea is that by imposing some constraints on the JSON syntax, unambiguous links can be drawn between datasets spanning very large domains through the use of common a common [[Namespace]], accessed via [[URI]].

This is how things like Google’s Knowledge Graph works. How Alexa and Siri get answers to their questions. How Wolfram Alpha operates (to some extent).

It is a JSON-based serialization for [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
